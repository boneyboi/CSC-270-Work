urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.1#CHAPTER I. PREJUDICES OF PHILOSOPHERS
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.2#1. The Will to Truth, which is to tempt us to many a hazardous
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.3#enterprise, the famous Truthfulness of which all philosophers have
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.4#hitherto spoken with respect, what questions has this Will to Truth not
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.5#laid before us! What strange, perplexing, questionable questions! It is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.6#already a long story; yet it seems as if it were hardly commenced. Is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.7#it any wonder if we at last grow distrustful, lose patience, and turn
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.8#impatiently away? That this Sphinx teaches us at last to ask questions
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.9#ourselves? WHO is it really that puts questions to us here? WHAT really
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.10#is this "Will to Truth" in us? In fact we made a long halt at the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.11#question as to the origin of this Will--until at last we came to an
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.12#absolute standstill before a yet more fundamental question. We inquired
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.13#about the VALUE of this Will. Granted that we want the truth: WHY NOT
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.14#RATHER untruth? And uncertainty? Even ignorance? The problem of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.15#value of truth presented itself before us--or was it we who presented
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.16#ourselves before the problem? Which of us is the Oedipus here? Which
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.17#the Sphinx? It would seem to be a rendezvous of questions and notes of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.18#interrogation. And could it be believed that it at last seems to us as
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.19#if the problem had never been propounded before, as if we were the first
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.20#to discern it, get a sight of it, and RISK RAISING it? For there is risk
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.21#in raising it, perhaps there is no greater risk.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.22#2. "HOW COULD anything originate out of its opposite? For example, truth
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.23#out of error? or the Will to Truth out of the will to deception? or the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.24#generous deed out of selfishness? or the pure sun-bright vision of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.25#wise man out of covetousness? Such genesis is impossible; whoever dreams
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.26#of it is a fool, nay, worse than a fool; things of the highest
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.27#value must have a different origin, an origin of THEIR own--in this
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.28#transitory, seductive, illusory, paltry world, in this turmoil of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.29#delusion and cupidity, they cannot have their source. But rather in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.30#the lap of Being, in the intransitory, in the concealed God, in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.31#'Thing-in-itself--THERE must be their source, and nowhere else!"--This
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.32#mode of reasoning discloses the typical prejudice by which
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.33#metaphysicians of all times can be recognized, this mode of valuation
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.34#is at the back of all their logical procedure; through this "belief" of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.35#theirs, they exert themselves for their "knowledge," for something that
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.36#is in the end solemnly christened "the Truth." The fundamental belief of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.37#metaphysicians is THE BELIEF IN ANTITHESES OF VALUES. It never occurred
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.38#even to the wariest of them to doubt here on the very threshold (where
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.39#doubt, however, was most necessary); though they had made a solemn
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.40#vow, "DE OMNIBUS DUBITANDUM." For it may be doubted, firstly, whether
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.41#antitheses exist at all; and secondly, whether the popular valuations
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.42#and antitheses of value upon which metaphysicians have set their
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.43#seal, are not perhaps merely superficial estimates, merely provisional
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.44#perspectives, besides being probably made from some corner, perhaps from
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.45#below--"frog perspectives," as it were, to borrow an expression current
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.46#among painters. In spite of all the value which may belong to the true,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.47#the positive, and the unselfish, it might be possible that a higher
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.48#and more fundamental value for life generally should be assigned to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.49#pretence, to the will to delusion, to selfishness, and cupidity. It
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.50#might even be possible that WHAT constitutes the value of those good and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.51#respected things, consists precisely in their being insidiously
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.52#related, knotted, and crocheted to these evil and apparently opposed
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.53#things--perhaps even in being essentially identical with them. Perhaps!
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.54#But who wishes to concern himself with such dangerous "Perhapses"!
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.55#For that investigation one must await the advent of a new order of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.56#philosophers, such as will have other tastes and inclinations, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.57#reverse of those hitherto prevalent--philosophers of the dangerous
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.58#"Perhaps" in every sense of the term. And to speak in all seriousness, I
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.59#see such new philosophers beginning to appear.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.60#3. Having kept a sharp eye on philosophers, and having read between
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.61#their lines long enough, I now say to myself that the greater part of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.62#conscious thinking must be counted among the instinctive functions, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.63#it is so even in the case of philosophical thinking; one has here to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.64#learn anew, as one learned anew about heredity and "innateness." As
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.65#little as the act of birth comes into consideration in the whole process
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.66#and procedure of heredity, just as little is "being-conscious" OPPOSED
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.67#to the instinctive in any decisive sense; the greater part of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.68#conscious thinking of a philosopher is secretly influenced by his
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.69#instincts, and forced into definite channels. And behind all logic and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.70#its seeming sovereignty of movement, there are valuations, or to speak
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.71#more plainly, physiological demands, for the maintenance of a definite
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.72#mode of life For example, that the certain is worth more than the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.73#uncertain, that illusion is less valuable than "truth" such valuations,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.74#in spite of their regulative importance for US, might notwithstanding be
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.75#only superficial valuations, special kinds of _niaiserie_, such as may
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.76#be necessary for the maintenance of beings such as ourselves. Supposing,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.77#in effect, that man is not just the "measure of things."
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.78#4. The falseness of an opinion is not for us any objection to it: it is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.79#here, perhaps, that our new language sounds most strangely. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.80#question is, how far an opinion is life-furthering, life-preserving,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.81#species-preserving, perhaps species-rearing, and we are fundamentally
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.82#inclined to maintain that the falsest opinions (to which the synthetic
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.83#judgments a priori belong), are the most indispensable to us, that
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.84#without a recognition of logical fictions, without a comparison of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.85#reality with the purely IMAGINED world of the absolute and immutable,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.86#without a constant counterfeiting of the world by means of numbers,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.87#man could not live--that the renunciation of false opinions would be
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.88#a renunciation of life, a negation of life. TO RECOGNISE UNTRUTH AS A
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.89#CONDITION OF LIFE; that is certainly to impugn the traditional ideas of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.90#value in a dangerous manner, and a philosophy which ventures to do so,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.91#has thereby alone placed itself beyond good and evil.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.92#5. That which causes philosophers to be regarded half-distrustfully
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.93#and half-mockingly, is not the oft-repeated discovery how innocent they
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.94#are--how often and easily they make mistakes and lose their way, in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.95#short, how childish and childlike they are,--but that there is not
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.96#enough honest dealing with them, whereas they all raise a loud and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.97#virtuous outcry when the problem of truthfulness is even hinted at in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.98#the remotest manner. They all pose as though their real opinions had
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.99#been discovered and attained through the self-evolving of a cold, pure,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.100#divinely indifferent dialectic (in contrast to all sorts of mystics,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.101#who, fairer and foolisher, talk of "inspiration"), whereas, in fact, a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.102#prejudiced proposition, idea, or "suggestion," which is generally
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.103#their heart's desire abstracted and refined, is defended by them with
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.104#arguments sought out after the event. They are all advocates who do not
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.105#wish to be regarded as such, generally astute defenders, also, of their
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.106#prejudices, which they dub "truths,"--and VERY far from having the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.107#conscience which bravely admits this to itself, very far from having
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.108#the good taste of the courage which goes so far as to let this be
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.109#understood, perhaps to warn friend or foe, or in cheerful confidence
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.110#and self-ridicule. The spectacle of the Tartuffery of old Kant, equally
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.111#stiff and decent, with which he entices us into the dialectic
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.112#by-ways that lead (more correctly mislead) to his "categorical
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.113#imperative"--makes us fastidious ones smile, we who find no small
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.114#amusement in spying out the subtle tricks of old moralists and ethical
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.115#preachers. Or, still more so, the hocus-pocus in mathematical form, by
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.116#means of which Spinoza has, as it were, clad his philosophy in mail and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.117#mask--in fact, the "love of HIS wisdom," to translate the term fairly
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.118#and squarely--in order thereby to strike terror at once into the heart
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.119#of the assailant who should dare to cast a glance on that invincible
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.120#maiden, that Pallas Athene:--how much of personal timidity and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.121#vulnerability does this masquerade of a sickly recluse betray!
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.122#6. It has gradually become clear to me what every great philosophy up
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.123#till now has consisted of--namely, the confession of its originator, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.124#a species of involuntary and unconscious auto-biography; and moreover
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.125#that the moral (or immoral) purpose in every philosophy has constituted
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.126#the true vital germ out of which the entire plant has always grown.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.127#Indeed, to understand how the abstrusest metaphysical assertions of a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.128#philosopher have been arrived at, it is always well (and wise) to first
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.129#ask oneself: "What morality do they (or does he) aim at?" Accordingly,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.130#I do not believe that an "impulse to knowledge" is the father of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.131#philosophy; but that another impulse, here as elsewhere, has only made
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.132#use of knowledge (and mistaken knowledge!) as an instrument. But whoever
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.133#considers the fundamental impulses of man with a view to determining
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.134#how far they may have here acted as INSPIRING GENII (or as demons and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.135#cobolds), will find that they have all practiced philosophy at one time
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.136#or another, and that each one of them would have been only too glad to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.137#look upon itself as the ultimate end of existence and the legitimate
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.138#LORD over all the other impulses. For every impulse is imperious, and as
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.139#SUCH, attempts to philosophize. To be sure, in the case of scholars, in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.140#the case of really scientific men, it may be otherwise--"better," if
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.141#you will; there there may really be such a thing as an "impulse to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.142#knowledge," some kind of small, independent clock-work, which, when well
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.143#wound up, works away industriously to that end, WITHOUT the rest of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.144#the scholarly impulses taking any material part therein. The actual
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.145#"interests" of the scholar, therefore, are generally in quite another
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.146#direction--in the family, perhaps, or in money-making, or in politics;
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.147#it is, in fact, almost indifferent at what point of research his little
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.148#machine is placed, and whether the hopeful young worker becomes a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.149#good philologist, a mushroom specialist, or a chemist; he is not
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.150#CHARACTERISED by becoming this or that. In the philosopher, on the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.151#contrary, there is absolutely nothing impersonal; and above all,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.152#his morality furnishes a decided and decisive testimony as to WHO HE
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.153#IS,--that is to say, in what order the deepest impulses of his nature
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.154#stand to each other.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.155#7. How malicious philosophers can be! I know of nothing more stinging
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.156#than the joke Epicurus took the liberty of making on Plato and the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.157#Platonists; he called them Dionysiokolakes. In its original sense,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.158#and on the face of it, the word signifies "Flatterers of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.159#Dionysius"--consequently, tyrants' accessories and lick-spittles;
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.160#besides this, however, it is as much as to say, "They are all ACTORS,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.161#there is nothing genuine about them" (for Dionysiokolax was a popular
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.162#name for an actor). And the latter is really the malignant reproach that
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.163#Epicurus cast upon Plato: he was annoyed by the grandiose manner, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.164#mise en scene style of which Plato and his scholars were masters--of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.165#which Epicurus was not a master! He, the old school-teacher of Samos,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.166#who sat concealed in his little garden at Athens, and wrote three
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.167#hundred books, perhaps out of rage and ambitious envy of Plato, who
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.168#knows! Greece took a hundred years to find out who the garden-god
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.169#Epicurus really was. Did she ever find out?
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.170#8. There is a point in every philosophy at which the "conviction" of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.171#the philosopher appears on the scene; or, to put it in the words of an
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.172#ancient mystery:
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.173#Adventavit asinus, Pulcher et fortissimus.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.174#9. You desire to LIVE "according to Nature"? Oh, you noble Stoics, what
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.175#fraud of words! Imagine to yourselves a being like Nature, boundlessly
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.176#extravagant, boundlessly indifferent, without purpose or consideration,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.177#without pity or justice, at once fruitful and barren and uncertain:
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.178#imagine to yourselves INDIFFERENCE as a power--how COULD you live
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.179#in accordance with such indifference? To live--is not that just
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.180#endeavouring to be otherwise than this Nature? Is not living valuing,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.181#preferring, being unjust, being limited, endeavouring to be different?
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.182#And granted that your imperative, "living according to Nature," means
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.183#actually the same as "living according to life"--how could you do
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.184#DIFFERENTLY? Why should you make a principle out of what you yourselves
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.185#are, and must be? In reality, however, it is quite otherwise with you:
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.186#while you pretend to read with rapture the canon of your law in Nature,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.187#you want something quite the contrary, you extraordinary stage-players
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.188#and self-deluders! In your pride you wish to dictate your morals and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.189#ideals to Nature, to Nature herself, and to incorporate them therein;
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.190#you insist that it shall be Nature "according to the Stoa," and would
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.191#like everything to be made after your own image, as a vast, eternal
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.192#glorification and generalism of Stoicism! With all your love for truth,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.193#you have forced yourselves so long, so persistently, and with such
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.194#hypnotic rigidity to see Nature FALSELY, that is to say, Stoically,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.195#that you are no longer able to see it otherwise--and to crown all, some
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.196#unfathomable superciliousness gives you the Bedlamite hope that
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.197#BECAUSE you are able to tyrannize over yourselves--Stoicism is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.198#self-tyranny--Nature will also allow herself to be tyrannized over: is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.199#not the Stoic a PART of Nature?... But this is an old and everlasting
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.200#story: what happened in old times with the Stoics still happens today,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.201#as soon as ever a philosophy begins to believe in itself. It always
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.202#creates the world in its own image; it cannot do otherwise; philosophy
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.203#is this tyrannical impulse itself, the most spiritual Will to Power, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.204#will to "creation of the world," the will to the causa prima.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.205#10. The eagerness and subtlety, I should even say craftiness, with
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.206#which the problem of "the real and the apparent world" is dealt with at
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.207#present throughout Europe, furnishes food for thought and attention; and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.208#he who hears only a "Will to Truth" in the background, and nothing else,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.209#cannot certainly boast of the sharpest ears. In rare and isolated
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.210#cases, it may really have happened that such a Will to Truth--a certain
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.211#extravagant and adventurous pluck, a metaphysician's ambition of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.212#forlorn hope--has participated therein: that which in the end always
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.213#prefers a handful of "certainty" to a whole cartload of beautiful
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.214#possibilities; there may even be puritanical fanatics of conscience,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.215#who prefer to put their last trust in a sure nothing, rather than in an
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.216#uncertain something. But that is Nihilism, and the sign of a despairing,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.217#mortally wearied soul, notwithstanding the courageous bearing such a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.218#virtue may display. It seems, however, to be otherwise with stronger
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.219#and livelier thinkers who are still eager for life. In that they side
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.220#AGAINST appearance, and speak superciliously of "perspective," in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.221#that they rank the credibility of their own bodies about as low as the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.222#credibility of the ocular evidence that "the earth stands still," and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.223#thus, apparently, allowing with complacency their securest possession
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.224#to escape (for what does one at present believe in more firmly than
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.225#in one's body?),--who knows if they are not really trying to win back
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.226#something which was formerly an even securer possession, something
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.227#of the old domain of the faith of former times, perhaps the "immortal
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.228#soul," perhaps "the old God," in short, ideas by which they could live
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.229#better, that is to say, more vigorously and more joyously, than by
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.230#"modern ideas"? There is DISTRUST of these modern ideas in this mode
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.231#of looking at things, a disbelief in all that has been constructed
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.232#yesterday and today; there is perhaps some slight admixture of satiety
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.233#and scorn, which can no longer endure the BRIC-A-BRAC of ideas of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.234#most varied origin, such as so-called Positivism at present throws on
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.235#the market; a disgust of the more refined taste at the village-fair
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.236#motleyness and patchiness of all these reality-philosophasters, in whom
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.237#there is nothing either new or true, except this motleyness. Therein it
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.238#seems to me that we should agree with those skeptical anti-realists and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.239#knowledge-microscopists of the present day; their instinct, which repels
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.240#them from MODERN reality, is unrefuted... what do their retrograde
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.241#by-paths concern us! The main thing about them is NOT that they wish
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.242#to go "back," but that they wish to get AWAY therefrom. A little MORE
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.243#strength, swing, courage, and artistic power, and they would be OFF--and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.244#not back!
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.245#11. It seems to me that there is everywhere an attempt at present to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.246#divert attention from the actual influence which Kant exercised on
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.247#German philosophy, and especially to ignore prudently the value which
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.248#he set upon himself. Kant was first and foremost proud of his Table of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.249#Categories; with it in his hand he said: "This is the most difficult
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.250#thing that could ever be undertaken on behalf of metaphysics." Let us
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.251#only understand this "could be"! He was proud of having DISCOVERED a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.252#new faculty in man, the faculty of synthetic judgment a priori. Granting
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.253#that he deceived himself in this matter; the development and rapid
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.254#flourishing of German philosophy depended nevertheless on his pride, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.255#on the eager rivalry of the younger generation to discover if possible
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.256#something--at all events "new faculties"--of which to be still
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.257#prouder!--But let us reflect for a moment--it is high time to do so.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.258#"How are synthetic judgments a priori POSSIBLE?" Kant asks himself--and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.259#what is really his answer? "BY MEANS OF A MEANS (faculty)"--but
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.260#unfortunately not in five words, but so circumstantially, imposingly,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.261#and with such display of German profundity and verbal flourishes, that
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.262#one altogether loses sight of the comical niaiserie allemande involved
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.263#in such an answer. People were beside themselves with delight over this
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.264#new faculty, and the jubilation reached its climax when Kant further
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.265#discovered a moral faculty in man--for at that time Germans were still
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.266#moral, not yet dabbling in the "Politics of hard fact." Then came
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.267#the honeymoon of German philosophy. All the young theologians of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.268#Tubingen institution went immediately into the groves--all seeking for
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.269#"faculties." And what did they not find--in that innocent, rich, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.270#still youthful period of the German spirit, to which Romanticism, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.271#malicious fairy, piped and sang, when one could not yet distinguish
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.272#between "finding" and "inventing"! Above all a faculty for the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.273#"transcendental"; Schelling christened it, intellectual intuition,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.274#and thereby gratified the most earnest longings of the naturally
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.275#pious-inclined Germans. One can do no greater wrong to the whole of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.276#this exuberant and eccentric movement (which was really youthfulness,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.277#notwithstanding that it disguised itself so boldly, in hoary and senile
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.278#conceptions), than to take it seriously, or even treat it with moral
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.279#indignation. Enough, however--the world grew older, and the dream
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.280#vanished. A time came when people rubbed their foreheads, and they still
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.281#rub them today. People had been dreaming, and first and foremost--old
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.282#Kant. "By means of a means (faculty)"--he had said, or at least meant to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.283#say. But, is that--an answer? An explanation? Or is it not rather merely
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.284#a repetition of the question? How does opium induce sleep? "By means of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.285#a means (faculty)," namely the virtus dormitiva, replies the doctor in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.286#Moliere,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.287#    Quia est in eo virtus dormitiva,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.288#    Cujus est natura sensus assoupire.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.289#But such replies belong to the realm of comedy, and it is high time
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.290#to replace the Kantian question, "How are synthetic judgments a PRIORI
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.291#possible?" by another question, "Why is belief in such judgments
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.292#necessary?"--in effect, it is high time that we should understand
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.293#that such judgments must be believed to be true, for the sake of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.294#preservation of creatures like ourselves; though they still might
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.295#naturally be false judgments! Or, more plainly spoken, and roughly and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.296#readily--synthetic judgments a priori should not "be possible" at all;
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.297#we have no right to them; in our mouths they are nothing but false
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.298#judgments. Only, of course, the belief in their truth is necessary, as
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.299#plausible belief and ocular evidence belonging to the perspective view
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.300#of life. And finally, to call to mind the enormous influence which
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.301#"German philosophy"--I hope you understand its right to inverted commas
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.302#(goosefeet)?--has exercised throughout the whole of Europe, there is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.303#no doubt that a certain VIRTUS DORMITIVA had a share in it; thanks to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.304#German philosophy, it was a delight to the noble idlers, the virtuous,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.305#the mystics, the artiste, the three-fourths Christians, and the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.306#political obscurantists of all nations, to find an antidote to the still
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.307#overwhelming sensualism which overflowed from the last century into
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.308#this, in short--"sensus assoupire."...
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.309#12. As regards materialistic atomism, it is one of the best-refuted
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.310#theories that have been advanced, and in Europe there is now perhaps
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.311#no one in the learned world so unscholarly as to attach serious
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.312#signification to it, except for convenient everyday use (as an
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.313#abbreviation of the means of expression)--thanks chiefly to the Pole
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.314#Boscovich: he and the Pole Copernicus have hitherto been the greatest
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.315#and most successful opponents of ocular evidence. For while Copernicus
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.316#has persuaded us to believe, contrary to all the senses, that the earth
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.317#does NOT stand fast, Boscovich has taught us to abjure the belief in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.318#last thing that "stood fast" of the earth--the belief in "substance," in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.319#"matter," in the earth-residuum, and particle-atom: it is the greatest
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.320#triumph over the senses that has hitherto been gained on earth. One
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.321#must, however, go still further, and also declare war, relentless war
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.322#to the knife, against the "atomistic requirements" which still lead a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.323#dangerous after-life in places where no one suspects them, like the more
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.324#celebrated "metaphysical requirements": one must also above all give
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.325#the finishing stroke to that other and more portentous atomism which
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.326#Christianity has taught best and longest, the SOUL-ATOMISM. Let it be
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.327#permitted to designate by this expression the belief which regards the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.328#soul as something indestructible, eternal, indivisible, as a monad,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.329#as an atomon: this belief ought to be expelled from science! Between
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.330#ourselves, it is not at all necessary to get rid of "the soul" thereby,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.331#and thus renounce one of the oldest and most venerated hypotheses--as
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.332#happens frequently to the clumsiness of naturalists, who can hardly
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.333#touch on the soul without immediately losing it. But the way is open
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.334#for new acceptations and refinements of the soul-hypothesis; and such
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.335#conceptions as "mortal soul," and "soul of subjective multiplicity,"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.336#and "soul as social structure of the instincts and passions," want
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.337#henceforth to have legitimate rights in science. In that the NEW
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.338#psychologist is about to put an end to the superstitions which have
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.339#hitherto flourished with almost tropical luxuriance around the idea of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.340#the soul, he is really, as it were, thrusting himself into a new desert
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.341#and a new distrust--it is possible that the older psychologists had a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.342#merrier and more comfortable time of it; eventually, however, he finds
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.343#that precisely thereby he is also condemned to INVENT--and, who knows?
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.344#perhaps to DISCOVER the new.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.345#13. Psychologists should bethink themselves before putting down the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.346#instinct of self-preservation as the cardinal instinct of an organic
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.347#being. A living thing seeks above all to DISCHARGE its strength--life
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.348#itself is WILL TO POWER; self-preservation is only one of the indirect
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.349#and most frequent RESULTS thereof. In short, here, as everywhere else,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.350#let us beware of SUPERFLUOUS teleological principles!--one of which
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.351#is the instinct of self-preservation (we owe it to Spinoza's
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.352#inconsistency). It is thus, in effect, that method ordains, which must
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.353#be essentially economy of principles.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.354#14. It is perhaps just dawning on five or six minds that natural
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.355#philosophy is only a world-exposition and world-arrangement (according
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.356#to us, if I may say so!) and NOT a world-explanation; but in so far as
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.357#it is based on belief in the senses, it is regarded as more, and for a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.358#long time to come must be regarded as more--namely, as an explanation.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.359#It has eyes and fingers of its own, it has ocular evidence and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.360#palpableness of its own: this operates fascinatingly, persuasively, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.361#CONVINCINGLY upon an age with fundamentally plebeian tastes--in fact, it
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.362#follows instinctively the canon of truth of eternal popular sensualism.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.363#What is clear, what is "explained"? Only that which can be seen and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.364#felt--one must pursue every problem thus far. Obversely, however, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.365#charm of the Platonic mode of thought, which was an ARISTOCRATIC mode,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.366#consisted precisely in RESISTANCE to obvious sense-evidence--perhaps
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.367#among men who enjoyed even stronger and more fastidious senses than our
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.368#contemporaries, but who knew how to find a higher triumph in remaining
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.369#masters of them: and this by means of pale, cold, grey conceptional
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.370#networks which they threw over the motley whirl of the senses--the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.371#mob of the senses, as Plato said. In this overcoming of the world, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.372#interpreting of the world in the manner of Plato, there was an ENJOYMENT
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.373#different from that which the physicists of today offer us--and likewise
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.374#the Darwinists and anti-teleologists among the physiological workers,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.375#with their principle of the "smallest possible effort," and the greatest
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.376#possible blunder. "Where there is nothing more to see or to grasp, there
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.377#is also nothing more for men to do"--that is certainly an imperative
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.378#different from the Platonic one, but it may notwithstanding be the right
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.379#imperative for a hardy, laborious race of machinists and bridge-builders
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.380#of the future, who have nothing but ROUGH work to perform.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.381#15. To study physiology with a clear conscience, one must insist on
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.382#the fact that the sense-organs are not phenomena in the sense of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.383#idealistic philosophy; as such they certainly could not be causes!
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.384#Sensualism, therefore, at least as regulative hypothesis, if not as
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.385#heuristic principle. What? And others say even that the external world
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.386#is the work of our organs? But then our body, as a part of this external
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.387#world, would be the work of our organs! But then our organs themselves
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.388#would be the work of our organs! It seems to me that this is a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.389#complete REDUCTIO AD ABSURDUM, if the conception CAUSA SUI is something
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.390#fundamentally absurd. Consequently, the external world is NOT the work
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.391#of our organs--?
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.392#16. There are still harmless self-observers who believe that there are
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.393#"immediate certainties"; for instance, "I think," or as the superstition
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.394#of Schopenhauer puts it, "I will"; as though cognition here got hold
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.395#of its object purely and simply as "the thing in itself," without any
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.396#falsification taking place either on the part of the subject or the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.397#object. I would repeat it, however, a hundred times, that "immediate
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.398#certainty," as well as "absolute knowledge" and the "thing in itself,"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.399#involve a CONTRADICTIO IN ADJECTO; we really ought to free ourselves
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.400#from the misleading significance of words! The people on their part may
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.401#think that cognition is knowing all about things, but the philosopher
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.402#must say to himself: "When I analyze the process that is expressed in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.403#the sentence, 'I think,' I find a whole series of daring assertions, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.404#argumentative proof of which would be difficult, perhaps impossible:
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.405#for instance, that it is _I_ who think, that there must necessarily be
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.406#something that thinks, that thinking is an activity and operation on the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.407#part of a being who is thought of as a cause, that there is an 'ego,'
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.408#and finally, that it is already determined what is to be designated by
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.409#thinking--that I KNOW what thinking is. For if I had not already decided
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.410#within myself what it is, by what standard could I determine whether
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.411#that which is just happening is not perhaps 'willing' or 'feeling'? In
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.412#short, the assertion 'I think,' assumes that I COMPARE my state at the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.413#present moment with other states of myself which I know, in order to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.414#determine what it is; on account of this retrospective connection with
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.415#further 'knowledge,' it has, at any rate, no immediate certainty for
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.416#me."--In place of the "immediate certainty" in which the people may
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.417#believe in the special case, the philosopher thus finds a series of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.418#metaphysical questions presented to him, veritable conscience questions
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.419#of the intellect, to wit: "Whence did I get the notion of 'thinking'?
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.420#Why do I believe in cause and effect? What gives me the right to speak
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.421#of an 'ego,' and even of an 'ego' as cause, and finally of an 'ego'
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.422#as cause of thought?" He who ventures to answer these metaphysical
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.423#questions at once by an appeal to a sort of INTUITIVE perception, like
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.424#the person who says, "I think, and know that this, at least, is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.425#true, actual, and certain"--will encounter a smile and two notes of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.426#interrogation in a philosopher nowadays. "Sir," the philosopher will
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.427#perhaps give him to understand, "it is improbable that you are not
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.428#mistaken, but why should it be the truth?"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.429#17. With regard to the superstitions of logicians, I shall never tire
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.430#of emphasizing a small, terse fact, which is unwillingly recognized by
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.431#these credulous minds--namely, that a thought comes when "it" wishes,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.432#and not when "I" wish; so that it is a PERVERSION of the facts of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.433#case to say that the subject "I" is the condition of the predicate
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.434#"think." ONE thinks; but that this "one" is precisely the famous old
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.435#"ego," is, to put it mildly, only a supposition, an assertion, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.436#assuredly not an "immediate certainty." After all, one has even gone too
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.437#far with this "one thinks"--even the "one" contains an INTERPRETATION of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.438#the process, and does not belong to the process itself. One infers here
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.439#according to the usual grammatical formula--"To think is an activity;
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.440#every activity requires an agency that is active; consequently"... It
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.441#was pretty much on the same lines that the older atomism sought, besides
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.442#the operating "power," the material particle wherein it resides and out
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.443#of which it operates--the atom. More rigorous minds, however, learnt at
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.444#last to get along without this "earth-residuum," and perhaps some day we
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.445#shall accustom ourselves, even from the logician's point of view, to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.446#get along without the little "one" (to which the worthy old "ego" has
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.447#refined itself).
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.448#18. It is certainly not the least charm of a theory that it is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.449#refutable; it is precisely thereby that it attracts the more subtle
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.450#minds. It seems that the hundred-times-refuted theory of the "free will"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.451#owes its persistence to this charm alone; some one is always appearing
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.452#who feels himself strong enough to refute it.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.453#19. Philosophers are accustomed to speak of the will as though it were
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.454#the best-known thing in the world; indeed, Schopenhauer has given us
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.455#to understand that the will alone is really known to us, absolutely and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.456#completely known, without deduction or addition. But it again and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.457#again seems to me that in this case Schopenhauer also only did what
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.458#philosophers are in the habit of doing--he seems to have adopted a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.459#POPULAR PREJUDICE and exaggerated it. Willing seems to me to be above
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.460#all something COMPLICATED, something that is a unity only in name--and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.461#it is precisely in a name that popular prejudice lurks, which has got
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.462#the mastery over the inadequate precautions of philosophers in all ages.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.463#So let us for once be more cautious, let us be "unphilosophical": let
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.464#us say that in all willing there is firstly a plurality of sensations,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.465#namely, the sensation of the condition "AWAY FROM WHICH we go," the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.466#sensation of the condition "TOWARDS WHICH we go," the sensation of this
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.467#"FROM" and "TOWARDS" itself, and then besides, an accompanying muscular
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.468#sensation, which, even without our putting in motion "arms and legs,"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.469#commences its action by force of habit, directly we "will" anything.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.470#Therefore, just as sensations (and indeed many kinds of sensations) are
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.471#to be recognized as ingredients of the will, so, in the second place,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.472#thinking is also to be recognized; in every act of the will there is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.473#a ruling thought;--and let us not imagine it possible to sever this
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.474#thought from the "willing," as if the will would then remain over!
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.475#In the third place, the will is not only a complex of sensation and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.476#thinking, but it is above all an EMOTION, and in fact the emotion of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.477#command. That which is termed "freedom of the will" is essentially the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.478#emotion of supremacy in respect to him who must obey: "I am free, 'he'
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.479#must obey"--this consciousness is inherent in every will; and equally
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.480#so the straining of the attention, the straight look which fixes itself
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.481#exclusively on one thing, the unconditional judgment that "this and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.482#nothing else is necessary now," the inward certainty that obedience
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.483#will be rendered--and whatever else pertains to the position of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.484#commander. A man who WILLS commands something within himself which
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.485#renders obedience, or which he believes renders obedience. But now let
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.486#us notice what is the strangest thing about the will,--this affair so
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.487#extremely complex, for which the people have only one name. Inasmuch as
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.488#in the given circumstances we are at the same time the commanding AND
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.489#the obeying parties, and as the obeying party we know the sensations of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.490#constraint, impulsion, pressure, resistance, and motion, which usually
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.491#commence immediately after the act of will; inasmuch as, on the other
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.492#hand, we are accustomed to disregard this duality, and to deceive
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.493#ourselves about it by means of the synthetic term "I": a whole series
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.494#of erroneous conclusions, and consequently of false judgments about the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.495#will itself, has become attached to the act of willing--to such a degree
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.496#that he who wills believes firmly that willing SUFFICES for action.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.497#Since in the majority of cases there has only been exercise of will
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.498#when the effect of the command--consequently obedience, and therefore
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.499#action--was to be EXPECTED, the APPEARANCE has translated itself into
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.500#the sentiment, as if there were a NECESSITY OF EFFECT; in a word, he who
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.501#wills believes with a fair amount of certainty that will and action are
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.502#somehow one; he ascribes the success, the carrying out of the willing,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.503#to the will itself, and thereby enjoys an increase of the sensation
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.504#of power which accompanies all success. "Freedom of Will"--that is the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.505#expression for the complex state of delight of the person exercising
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.506#volition, who commands and at the same time identifies himself with
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.507#the executor of the order--who, as such, enjoys also the triumph over
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.508#obstacles, but thinks within himself that it was really his own will
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.509#that overcame them. In this way the person exercising volition adds the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.510#feelings of delight of his successful executive instruments, the useful
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.511#"underwills" or under-souls--indeed, our body is but a social structure
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.512#composed of many souls--to his feelings of delight as commander. L'EFFET
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.513#C'EST MOI. what happens here is what happens in every well-constructed
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.514#and happy commonwealth, namely, that the governing class identifies
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.515#itself with the successes of the commonwealth. In all willing it is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.516#absolutely a question of commanding and obeying, on the basis, as
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.517#already said, of a social structure composed of many "souls", on which
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.518#account a philosopher should claim the right to include willing-as-such
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.519#within the sphere of morals--regarded as the doctrine of the relations
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.520#of supremacy under which the phenomenon of "life" manifests itself.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.521#20. That the separate philosophical ideas are not anything optional or
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.522#autonomously evolving, but grow up in connection and relationship with
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.523#each other, that, however suddenly and arbitrarily they seem to appear
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.524#in the history of thought, they nevertheless belong just as much to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.525#a system as the collective members of the fauna of a Continent--is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.526#betrayed in the end by the circumstance: how unfailingly the most
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.527#diverse philosophers always fill in again a definite fundamental scheme
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.528#of POSSIBLE philosophies. Under an invisible spell, they always revolve
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.529#once more in the same orbit, however independent of each other they
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.530#may feel themselves with their critical or systematic wills, something
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.531#within them leads them, something impels them in definite order the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.532#one after the other--to wit, the innate methodology and relationship
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.533#of their ideas. Their thinking is, in fact, far less a discovery than a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.534#re-recognizing, a remembering, a return and a home-coming to a far-off,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.535#ancient common-household of the soul, out of which those ideas formerly
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.536#grew: philosophizing is so far a kind of atavism of the highest order.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.537#The wonderful family resemblance of all Indian, Greek, and German
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.538#philosophizing is easily enough explained. In fact, where there is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.539#affinity of language, owing to the common philosophy of grammar--I mean
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.540#owing to the unconscious domination and guidance of similar grammatical
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.541#functions--it cannot but be that everything is prepared at the outset
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.542#for a similar development and succession of philosophical systems,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.543#just as the way seems barred against certain other possibilities of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.544#world-interpretation. It is highly probable that philosophers within the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.545#domain of the Ural-Altaic languages (where the conception of the subject
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.546#is least developed) look otherwise "into the world," and will be
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.547#found on paths of thought different from those of the Indo-Germans and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.548#Mussulmans, the spell of certain grammatical functions is ultimately
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.549#also the spell of PHYSIOLOGICAL valuations and racial conditions.--So
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.550#much by way of rejecting Locke's superficiality with regard to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.551#origin of ideas.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.552#21. The CAUSA SUI is the best self-contradiction that has yet been
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.553#conceived, it is a sort of logical violation and unnaturalness; but the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.554#extravagant pride of man has managed to entangle itself profoundly and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.555#frightfully with this very folly. The desire for "freedom of will"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.556#in the superlative, metaphysical sense, such as still holds sway,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.557#unfortunately, in the minds of the half-educated, the desire to bear
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.558#the entire and ultimate responsibility for one's actions oneself, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.559#to absolve God, the world, ancestors, chance, and society therefrom,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.560#involves nothing less than to be precisely this CAUSA SUI, and, with
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.561#more than Munchausen daring, to pull oneself up into existence by the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.562#hair, out of the slough of nothingness. If any one should find out in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.563#this manner the crass stupidity of the celebrated conception of "free
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.564#will" and put it out of his head altogether, I beg of him to carry
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.565#his "enlightenment" a step further, and also put out of his head the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.566#contrary of this monstrous conception of "free will": I mean "non-free
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.567#will," which is tantamount to a misuse of cause and effect. One
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.568#should not wrongly MATERIALISE "cause" and "effect," as the natural
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.569#philosophers do (and whoever like them naturalize in thinking at
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.570#present), according to the prevailing mechanical doltishness which makes
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.571#the cause press and push until it "effects" its end; one should use
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.572#"cause" and "effect" only as pure CONCEPTIONS, that is to say, as
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.573#conventional fictions for the purpose of designation and mutual
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.574#understanding,--NOT for explanation. In "being-in-itself" there is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.575#nothing of "casual-connection," of "necessity," or of "psychological
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.576#non-freedom"; there the effect does NOT follow the cause, there "law"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.577#does not obtain. It is WE alone who have devised cause, sequence,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.578#reciprocity, relativity, constraint, number, law, freedom, motive,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.579#and purpose; and when we interpret and intermix this symbol-world,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.580#as "being-in-itself," with things, we act once more as we have always
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.581#acted--MYTHOLOGICALLY. The "non-free will" is mythology; in real life
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.582#it is only a question of STRONG and WEAK wills.--It is almost always
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.583#a symptom of what is lacking in himself, when a thinker, in every
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.584#"causal-connection" and "psychological necessity," manifests something
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.585#of compulsion, indigence, obsequiousness, oppression, and non-freedom;
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.586#it is suspicious to have such feelings--the person betrays himself. And
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.587#in general, if I have observed correctly, the "non-freedom of the will"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.588#is regarded as a problem from two entirely opposite standpoints, but
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.589#always in a profoundly PERSONAL manner: some will not give up their
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.590#"responsibility," their belief in THEMSELVES, the personal right to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.591#THEIR merits, at any price (the vain races belong to this class); others
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.592#on the contrary, do not wish to be answerable for anything, or blamed
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.593#for anything, and owing to an inward self-contempt, seek to GET OUT OF
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.594#THE BUSINESS, no matter how. The latter, when they write books, are
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.595#in the habit at present of taking the side of criminals; a sort of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.596#socialistic sympathy is their favourite disguise. And as a matter of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.597#fact, the fatalism of the weak-willed embellishes itself surprisingly
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.598#when it can pose as "la religion de la souffrance humaine"; that is ITS
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.599#"good taste."
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.600#22. Let me be pardoned, as an old philologist who cannot desist from
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.601#the mischief of putting his finger on bad modes of interpretation, but
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.602#"Nature's conformity to law," of which you physicists talk so proudly,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.603#as though--why, it exists only owing to your interpretation and bad
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.604#"philology." It is no matter of fact, no "text," but rather just a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.605#naively humanitarian adjustment and perversion of meaning, with which
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.606#you make abundant concessions to the democratic instincts of the modern
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.607#soul! "Everywhere equality before the law--Nature is not different in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.608#that respect, nor better than we": a fine instance of secret motive,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.609#in which the vulgar antagonism to everything privileged and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.610#autocratic--likewise a second and more refined atheism--is once more
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.611#disguised. "Ni dieu, ni maitre"--that, also, is what you want; and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.612#therefore "Cheers for natural law!"--is it not so? But, as has been
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.613#said, that is interpretation, not text; and somebody might come along,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.614#who, with opposite intentions and modes of interpretation, could read
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.615#out of the same "Nature," and with regard to the same phenomena, just
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.616#the tyrannically inconsiderate and relentless enforcement of the claims
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.617#of power--an interpreter who should so place the unexceptionalness and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.618#unconditionalness of all "Will to Power" before your eyes, that almost
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.619#every word, and the word "tyranny" itself, would eventually seem
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.620#unsuitable, or like a weakening and softening metaphor--as being too
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.621#human; and who should, nevertheless, end by asserting the same about
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.622#this world as you do, namely, that it has a "necessary" and "calculable"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.623#course, NOT, however, because laws obtain in it, but because they are
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.624#absolutely LACKING, and every power effects its ultimate consequences
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.625#every moment. Granted that this also is only interpretation--and you
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.626#will be eager enough to make this objection?--well, so much the better.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.627#23. All psychology hitherto has run aground on moral prejudices and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.628#timidities, it has not dared to launch out into the depths. In so far
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.629#as it is allowable to recognize in that which has hitherto been written,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.630#evidence of that which has hitherto been kept silent, it seems as if
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.631#nobody had yet harboured the notion of psychology as the Morphology
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.632#and DEVELOPMENT-DOCTRINE OF THE WILL TO POWER, as I conceive of it.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.633#The power of moral prejudices has penetrated deeply into the most
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.634#intellectual world, the world apparently most indifferent and

urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.636#blinding, and distorting manner. A proper physio-psychology has to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.637#contend with unconscious antagonism in the heart of the investigator,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.638#it has "the heart" against it even a doctrine of the reciprocal
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.639#conditionalness of the "good" and the "bad" impulses, causes (as
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.640#refined immorality) distress and aversion in a still strong and manly
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.641#conscience--still more so, a doctrine of the derivation of all good
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.642#impulses from bad ones. If, however, a person should regard even
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.643#the emotions of hatred, envy, covetousness, and imperiousness
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.644#as life-conditioning emotions, as factors which must be present,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.645#fundamentally and essentially, in the general economy of life (which
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.646#must, therefore, be further developed if life is to be further
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.647#developed), he will suffer from such a view of things as from
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.648#sea-sickness. And yet this hypothesis is far from being the strangest
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.649#and most painful in this immense and almost new domain of dangerous
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.650#knowledge, and there are in fact a hundred good reasons why every one
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.651#should keep away from it who CAN do so! On the other hand, if one has
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.652#once drifted hither with one's bark, well! very good! now let us set our
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.653#teeth firmly! let us open our eyes and keep our hand fast on the helm!
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.654#We sail away right OVER morality, we crush out, we destroy perhaps the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.655#remains of our own morality by daring to make our voyage thither--but
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.656#what do WE matter. Never yet did a PROFOUNDER world of insight reveal
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.657#itself to daring travelers and adventurers, and the psychologist who
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.658#thus "makes a sacrifice"--it is not the sacrifizio dell' intelletto,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.659#on the contrary!--will at least be entitled to demand in return that
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.660#psychology shall once more be recognized as the queen of the sciences,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.661#for whose service and equipment the other sciences exist. For psychology
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:1.662#is once more the path to the fundamental problems.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.1#CHAPTER II. THE FREE SPIRIT
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.2#24. O sancta simplicitas! In what strange simplification and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.3#falsification man lives! One can never cease wondering when once one has
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.4#got eyes for beholding this marvel! How we have made everything around
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.5#us clear and free and easy and simple! how we have been able to give
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.6#our senses a passport to everything superficial, our thoughts a godlike
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.7#desire for wanton pranks and wrong inferences!--how from the beginning,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.8#we have contrived to retain our ignorance in order to enjoy an almost
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.9#inconceivable freedom, thoughtlessness, imprudence, heartiness,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.10#and gaiety--in order to enjoy life! And only on this solidified,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.11#granite-like foundation of ignorance could knowledge rear itself
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.12#hitherto, the will to knowledge on the foundation of a far more powerful
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.13#will, the will to ignorance, to the uncertain, to the untrue! Not as
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.14#its opposite, but--as its refinement! It is to be hoped, indeed, that
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.15#LANGUAGE, here as elsewhere, will not get over its awkwardness, and that
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.16#it will continue to talk of opposites where there are only degrees
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.17#and many refinements of gradation; it is equally to be hoped that the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.18#incarnated Tartuffery of morals, which now belongs to our unconquerable
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.19#"flesh and blood," will turn the words round in the mouths of us
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.20#discerning ones. Here and there we understand it, and laugh at the way
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.21#in which precisely the best knowledge seeks most to retain us in this
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.22#SIMPLIFIED, thoroughly artificial, suitably imagined, and suitably
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.23#falsified world: at the way in which, whether it will or not, it loves
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.24#error, because, as living itself, it loves life!
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.25#25. After such a cheerful commencement, a serious word would fain be
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.26#heard; it appeals to the most serious minds. Take care, ye philosophers
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.27#and friends of knowledge, and beware of martyrdom! Of suffering "for the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.28#truth's sake"! even in your own defense! It spoils all the innocence
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.29#and fine neutrality of your conscience; it makes you headstrong against
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.30#objections and red rags; it stupefies, animalizes, and brutalizes, when
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.31#in the struggle with danger, slander, suspicion, expulsion, and even
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.32#worse consequences of enmity, ye have at last to play your last card
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.33#as protectors of truth upon earth--as though "the Truth" were such an
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.34#innocent and incompetent creature as to require protectors! and you of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.35#all people, ye knights of the sorrowful countenance, Messrs Loafers and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.36#Cobweb-spinners of the spirit! Finally, ye know sufficiently well that
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.37#it cannot be of any consequence if YE just carry your point; ye know
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.38#that hitherto no philosopher has carried his point, and that there might
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.39#be a more laudable truthfulness in every little interrogative mark
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.40#which you place after your special words and favourite doctrines (and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.41#occasionally after yourselves) than in all the solemn pantomime and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.42#trumping games before accusers and law-courts! Rather go out of the way!
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.43#Flee into concealment! And have your masks and your ruses, that ye may
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.44#be mistaken for what you are, or somewhat feared! And pray, don't forget
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.45#the garden, the garden with golden trellis-work! And have people around
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.46#you who are as a garden--or as music on the waters at eventide, when
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.47#already the day becomes a memory. Choose the GOOD solitude, the free,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.48#wanton, lightsome solitude, which also gives you the right still to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.49#remain good in any sense whatsoever! How poisonous, how crafty, how bad,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.50#does every long war make one, which cannot be waged openly by means
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.51#of force! How PERSONAL does a long fear make one, a long watching
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.52#of enemies, of possible enemies! These pariahs of society, these
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.53#long-pursued, badly-persecuted ones--also the compulsory recluses, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.54#Spinozas or Giordano Brunos--always become in the end, even under the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.55#most intellectual masquerade, and perhaps without being themselves aware
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.56#of it, refined vengeance-seekers and poison-Brewers (just lay bare
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.57#the foundation of Spinoza's ethics and theology!), not to speak of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.58#the stupidity of moral indignation, which is the unfailing sign in a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.59#philosopher that the sense of philosophical humour has left him. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.60#martyrdom of the philosopher, his "sacrifice for the sake of truth,"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.61#forces into the light whatever of the agitator and actor lurks in him;
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.62#and if one has hitherto contemplated him only with artistic curiosity,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.63#with regard to many a philosopher it is easy to understand the dangerous
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.64#desire to see him also in his deterioration (deteriorated into a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.65#"martyr," into a stage-and-tribune-bawler). Only, that it is necessary
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.66#with such a desire to be clear WHAT spectacle one will see in any
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.67#case--merely a satyric play, merely an epilogue farce, merely the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.68#continued proof that the long, real tragedy IS AT AN END, supposing that
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.69#every philosophy has been a long tragedy in its origin.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.70#26. Every select man strives instinctively for a citadel and a privacy,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.71#where he is FREE from the crowd, the many, the majority--where he may
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.72#forget "men who are the rule," as their exception;--exclusive only of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.73#the case in which he is pushed straight to such men by a still stronger
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.74#instinct, as a discerner in the great and exceptional sense. Whoever, in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.75#intercourse with men, does not occasionally glisten in all the green
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.76#and grey colours of distress, owing to disgust, satiety, sympathy,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.77#gloominess, and solitariness, is assuredly not a man of elevated tastes;
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.78#supposing, however, that he does not voluntarily take all this burden
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.79#and disgust upon himself, that he persistently avoids it, and remains,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.80#as I said, quietly and proudly hidden in his citadel, one thing is then
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.81#certain: he was not made, he was not predestined for knowledge. For as
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.82#such, he would one day have to say to himself: "The devil take my good
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.83#taste! but 'the rule' is more interesting than the exception--than
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.84#myself, the exception!" And he would go DOWN, and above all, he would
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.85#go "inside." The long and serious study of the AVERAGE man--and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.86#consequently much disguise, self-overcoming, familiarity, and bad
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.87#intercourse (all intercourse is bad intercourse except with one's
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.88#equals):--that constitutes a necessary part of the life-history of every
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.89#philosopher; perhaps the most disagreeable, odious, and disappointing
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.90#part. If he is fortunate, however, as a favourite child of knowledge
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.91#should be, he will meet with suitable auxiliaries who will shorten and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.92#lighten his task; I mean so-called cynics, those who simply recognize
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.93#the animal, the commonplace and "the rule" in themselves, and at the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.94#same time have so much spirituality and ticklishness as to make them
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.95#talk of themselves and their like BEFORE WITNESSES--sometimes they
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.96#wallow, even in books, as on their own dung-hill. Cynicism is the only
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.97#form in which base souls approach what is called honesty; and the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.98#higher man must open his ears to all the coarser or finer cynicism, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.99#congratulate himself when the clown becomes shameless right before
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.100#him, or the scientific satyr speaks out. There are even cases where
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.101#enchantment mixes with the disgust--namely, where by a freak of nature,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.102#genius is bound to some such indiscreet billy-goat and ape, as in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.103#case of the Abbe Galiani, the profoundest, acutest, and perhaps also
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.104#filthiest man of his century--he was far profounder than Voltaire, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.105#consequently also, a good deal more silent. It happens more frequently,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.106#as has been hinted, that a scientific head is placed on an ape's body, a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.107#fine exceptional understanding in a base soul, an occurrence by no means
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.108#rare, especially among doctors and moral physiologists. And whenever
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.109#anyone speaks without bitterness, or rather quite innocently, of man
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.110#as a belly with two requirements, and a head with one; whenever any one
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.111#sees, seeks, and WANTS to see only hunger, sexual instinct, and vanity
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.112#as the real and only motives of human actions; in short, when any one
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.113#speaks "badly"--and not even "ill"--of man, then ought the lover of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.114#knowledge to hearken attentively and diligently; he ought, in general,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.115#to have an open ear wherever there is talk without indignation. For the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.116#indignant man, and he who perpetually tears and lacerates himself with
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.117#his own teeth (or, in place of himself, the world, God, or society),
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.118#may indeed, morally speaking, stand higher than the laughing and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.119#self-satisfied satyr, but in every other sense he is the more ordinary,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.120#more indifferent, and less instructive case. And no one is such a LIAR
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.121#as the indignant man.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.122#27. It is difficult to be understood, especially when one thinks and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.123#lives gangasrotogati [Footnote: Like the river Ganges: presto.] among
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.124#those only who think and live otherwise--namely, kurmagati [Footnote:
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.125#Like the tortoise: lento.], or at best "froglike," mandeikagati
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.126#[Footnote: Like the frog: staccato.] (I do everything to be "difficultly
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.127#understood" myself!)--and one should be heartily grateful for the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.128#good will to some refinement of interpretation. As regards "the good
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.129#friends," however, who are always too easy-going, and think that as
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.130#friends they have a right to ease, one does well at the very first to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.131#grant them a play-ground and romping-place for misunderstanding--one can
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.132#thus laugh still; or get rid of them altogether, these good friends--and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.133#laugh then also!
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.134#28. What is most difficult to render from one language into another
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.135#is the TEMPO of its style, which has its basis in the character of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.136#race, or to speak more physiologically, in the average TEMPO of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.137#assimilation of its nutriment. There are honestly meant translations,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.138#which, as involuntary vulgarizations, are almost falsifications of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.139#original, merely because its lively and merry TEMPO (which overleaps and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.140#obviates all dangers in word and expression) could not also be
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.141#rendered. A German is almost incapacitated for PRESTO in his language;
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.142#consequently also, as may be reasonably inferred, for many of the most
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.143#delightful and daring NUANCES of free, free-spirited thought. And just
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.144#as the buffoon and satyr are foreign to him in body and conscience,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.145#so Aristophanes and Petronius are untranslatable for him. Everything
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.146#ponderous, viscous, and pompously clumsy, all long-winded and wearying
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.147#species of style, are developed in profuse variety among Germans--pardon
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.148#me for stating the fact that even Goethe's prose, in its mixture of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.149#stiffness and elegance, is no exception, as a reflection of the "good
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.150#old time" to which it belongs, and as an expression of German taste at a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.151#time when there was still a "German taste," which was a rococo-taste
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.152#in moribus et artibus. Lessing is an exception, owing to his histrionic
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.153#nature, which understood much, and was versed in many things; he who was
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.154#not the translator of Bayle to no purpose, who took refuge willingly in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.155#the shadow of Diderot and Voltaire, and still more willingly among the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.156#Roman comedy-writers--Lessing loved also free-spiritism in the TEMPO,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.157#and flight out of Germany. But how could the German language, even
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.158#in the prose of Lessing, imitate the TEMPO of Machiavelli, who in his
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.159#"Principe" makes us breathe the dry, fine air of Florence, and cannot
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.160#help presenting the most serious events in a boisterous allegrissimo,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.161#perhaps not without a malicious artistic sense of the contrast he
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.162#ventures to present--long, heavy, difficult, dangerous thoughts, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.163#a TEMPO of the gallop, and of the best, wantonest humour? Finally, who
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.164#would venture on a German translation of Petronius, who, more than any
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.165#great musician hitherto, was a master of PRESTO in invention, ideas, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.166#words? What matter in the end about the swamps of the sick, evil world,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.167#or of the "ancient world," when like him, one has the feet of a wind,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.168#the rush, the breath, the emancipating scorn of a wind, which makes
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.169#everything healthy, by making everything RUN! And with regard to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.170#Aristophanes--that transfiguring, complementary genius, for whose
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.171#sake one PARDONS all Hellenism for having existed, provided one has
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.172#understood in its full profundity ALL that there requires pardon and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.173#transfiguration; there is nothing that has caused me to meditate more on
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.174#PLATO'S secrecy and sphinx-like nature, than the happily preserved petit
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.175#fait that under the pillow of his death-bed there was found no
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.176#"Bible," nor anything Egyptian, Pythagorean, or Platonic--but a book of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.177#Aristophanes. How could even Plato have endured life--a Greek life which
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.178#he repudiated--without an Aristophanes!
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.179#29. It is the business of the very few to be independent; it is a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.180#privilege of the strong. And whoever attempts it, even with the best
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.181#right, but without being OBLIGED to do so, proves that he is probably
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.182#not only strong, but also daring beyond measure. He enters into a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.183#labyrinth, he multiplies a thousandfold the dangers which life in itself
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.184#already brings with it; not the least of which is that no one can see
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.185#how and where he loses his way, becomes isolated, and is torn piecemeal
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.186#by some minotaur of conscience. Supposing such a one comes to grief, it
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.187#is so far from the comprehension of men that they neither feel it, nor
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.188#sympathize with it. And he cannot any longer go back! He cannot even go
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.189#back again to the sympathy of men!
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.190#30. Our deepest insights must--and should--appear as follies, and under
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.191#certain circumstances as crimes, when they come unauthorizedly to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.192#the ears of those who are not disposed and predestined for them. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.193#exoteric and the esoteric, as they were formerly distinguished by
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.194#philosophers--among the Indians, as among the Greeks, Persians, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.195#Mussulmans, in short, wherever people believed in gradations of rank and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.196#NOT in equality and equal rights--are not so much in contradistinction
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.197#to one another in respect to the exoteric class, standing without, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.198#viewing, estimating, measuring, and judging from the outside, and not
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.199#from the inside; the more essential distinction is that the class in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.200#question views things from below upwards--while the esoteric class views
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.201#things FROM ABOVE DOWNWARDS. There are heights of the soul from which
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.202#tragedy itself no longer appears to operate tragically; and if all the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.203#woe in the world were taken together, who would dare to decide whether
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.204#the sight of it would NECESSARILY seduce and constrain to sympathy, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.205#thus to a doubling of the woe?... That which serves the higher class of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.206#men for nourishment or refreshment, must be almost poison to an entirely
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.207#different and lower order of human beings. The virtues of the common
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.208#man would perhaps mean vice and weakness in a philosopher; it might be
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.209#possible for a highly developed man, supposing him to degenerate and go
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.210#to ruin, to acquire qualities thereby alone, for the sake of which he
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.211#would have to be honoured as a saint in the lower world into which he
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.212#had sunk. There are books which have an inverse value for the soul and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.213#the health according as the inferior soul and the lower vitality, or the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.214#higher and more powerful, make use of them. In the former case they are
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.215#dangerous, disturbing, unsettling books, in the latter case they are
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.216#herald-calls which summon the bravest to THEIR bravery. Books for the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.217#general reader are always ill-smelling books, the odour of paltry people
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.218#clings to them. Where the populace eat and drink, and even where they
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.219#reverence, it is accustomed to stink. One should not go into churches if
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.220#one wishes to breathe PURE air.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.221#31. In our youthful years we still venerate and despise without the art
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.222#of NUANCE, which is the best gain of life, and we have rightly to do
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.223#hard penance for having fallen upon men and things with Yea and Nay.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.224#Everything is so arranged that the worst of all tastes, THE TASTE FOR
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.225#THE UNCONDITIONAL, is cruelly befooled and abused, until a man learns
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.226#to introduce a little art into his sentiments, and prefers to try
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.227#conclusions with the artificial, as do the real artists of life. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.228#angry and reverent spirit peculiar to youth appears to allow itself no
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.229#peace, until it has suitably falsified men and things, to be able
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.230#to vent its passion upon them: youth in itself even, is something
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.231#falsifying and deceptive. Later on, when the young soul, tortured by
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.232#continual disillusions, finally turns suspiciously against itself--still
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.233#ardent and savage even in its suspicion and remorse of conscience: how
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.234#it upbraids itself, how impatiently it tears itself, how it revenges
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.235#itself for its long self-blinding, as though it had been a voluntary
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.236#blindness! In this transition one punishes oneself by distrust of one's
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.237#sentiments; one tortures one's enthusiasm with doubt, one feels even the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.238#good conscience to be a danger, as if it were the self-concealment and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.239#lassitude of a more refined uprightness; and above all, one espouses
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.240#upon principle the cause AGAINST "youth."--A decade later, and one
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.241#comprehends that all this was also still--youth!
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.242#32. Throughout the longest period of human history--one calls it the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.243#prehistoric period--the value or non-value of an action was inferred
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.244#from its CONSEQUENCES; the action in itself was not taken into
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.245#consideration, any more than its origin; but pretty much as in China at
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.246#present, where the distinction or disgrace of a child redounds to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.247#its parents, the retro-operating power of success or failure was what
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.248#induced men to think well or ill of an action. Let us call this period
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.249#the PRE-MORAL period of mankind; the imperative, "Know thyself!" was
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.250#then still unknown.--In the last ten thousand years, on the other hand,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.251#on certain large portions of the earth, one has gradually got so far,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.252#that one no longer lets the consequences of an action, but its origin,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.253#decide with regard to its worth: a great achievement as a whole, an
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.254#important refinement of vision and of criterion, the unconscious effect
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.255#of the supremacy of aristocratic values and of the belief in "origin,"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.256#the mark of a period which may be designated in the narrower sense as
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.257#the MORAL one: the first attempt at self-knowledge is thereby
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.258#made. Instead of the consequences, the origin--what an inversion
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.259#of perspective! And assuredly an inversion effected only after long
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.260#struggle and wavering! To be sure, an ominous new superstition, a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.261#peculiar narrowness of interpretation, attained supremacy precisely
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.262#thereby: the origin of an action was interpreted in the most definite
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.263#sense possible, as origin out of an INTENTION; people were agreed in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.264#belief that the value of an action lay in the value of its intention.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.265#The intention as the sole origin and antecedent history of an action:
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.266#under the influence of this prejudice moral praise and blame have been
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.267#bestowed, and men have judged and even philosophized almost up to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.268#present day.--Is it not possible, however, that the necessity may now
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.269#have arisen of again making up our minds with regard to the reversing
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.270#and fundamental shifting of values, owing to a new self-consciousness
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.271#and acuteness in man--is it not possible that we may be standing on
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.272#the threshold of a period which to begin with, would be distinguished
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.273#negatively as ULTRA-MORAL: nowadays when, at least among us immoralists,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.274#the suspicion arises that the decisive value of an action lies precisely
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.275#in that which is NOT INTENTIONAL, and that all its intentionalness, all
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.276#that is seen, sensible, or "sensed" in it, belongs to its surface or
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.277#skin--which, like every skin, betrays something, but CONCEALS still
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.278#more? In short, we believe that the intention is only a sign or symptom,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.279#which first requires an explanation--a sign, moreover, which has too
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.280#many interpretations, and consequently hardly any meaning in itself
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.281#alone: that morality, in the sense in which it has been understood
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.282#hitherto, as intention-morality, has been a prejudice, perhaps a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.283#prematureness or preliminariness, probably something of the same rank
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.284#as astrology and alchemy, but in any case something which must be
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.285#surmounted. The surmounting of morality, in a certain sense even the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.286#self-mounting of morality--let that be the name for the long-secret
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.287#labour which has been reserved for the most refined, the most upright,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.288#and also the most wicked consciences of today, as the living touchstones
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.289#of the soul.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.290#33. It cannot be helped: the sentiment of surrender, of sacrifice for
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.291#one's neighbour, and all self-renunciation-morality, must be mercilessly
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.292#called to account, and brought to judgment; just as the aesthetics
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.293#of "disinterested contemplation," under which the emasculation of art
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.294#nowadays seeks insidiously enough to create itself a good conscience.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.295#There is far too much witchery and sugar in the sentiments "for others"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.296#and "NOT for myself," for one not needing to be doubly distrustful here,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.297#and for one asking promptly: "Are they not perhaps--DECEPTIONS?"--That
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.298#they PLEASE--him who has them, and him who enjoys their fruit, and also
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.299#the mere spectator--that is still no argument in their FAVOUR, but just
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.300#calls for caution. Let us therefore be cautious!
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.301#34. At whatever standpoint of philosophy one may place oneself nowadays,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.302#seen from every position, the ERRONEOUSNESS of the world in which we
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.303#think we live is the surest and most certain thing our eyes can light
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.304#upon: we find proof after proof thereof, which would fain allure us into
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.305#surmises concerning a deceptive principle in the "nature of things."
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.306#He, however, who makes thinking itself, and consequently "the spirit,"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.307#responsible for the falseness of the world--an honourable exit, which
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.308#every conscious or unconscious advocatus dei avails himself of--he
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.309#who regards this world, including space, time, form, and movement, as
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.310#falsely DEDUCED, would have at least good reason in the end to become
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.311#distrustful also of all thinking; has it not hitherto been playing upon
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.312#us the worst of scurvy tricks? and what guarantee would it give that
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.313#it would not continue to do what it has always been doing? In all
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.314#seriousness, the innocence of thinkers has something touching and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.315#respect-inspiring in it, which even nowadays permits them to wait upon
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.316#consciousness with the request that it will give them HONEST answers:
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.317#for example, whether it be "real" or not, and why it keeps the outer
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.318#world so resolutely at a distance, and other questions of the same
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.319#description. The belief in "immediate certainties" is a MORAL NAIVETE
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.320#which does honour to us philosophers; but--we have now to cease being
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.321#"MERELY moral" men! Apart from morality, such belief is a folly which
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.322#does little honour to us! If in middle-class life an ever-ready distrust
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.323#is regarded as the sign of a "bad character," and consequently as an
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.324#imprudence, here among us, beyond the middle-class world and its Yeas
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.325#and Nays, what should prevent our being imprudent and saying: the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.326#philosopher has at length a RIGHT to "bad character," as the being who
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.327#has hitherto been most befooled on earth--he is now under OBLIGATION
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.328#to distrustfulness, to the wickedest squinting out of every abyss of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.329#suspicion.--Forgive me the joke of this gloomy grimace and turn of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.330#expression; for I myself have long ago learned to think and estimate
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.331#differently with regard to deceiving and being deceived, and I keep at
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.332#least a couple of pokes in the ribs ready for the blind rage with which
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.333#philosophers struggle against being deceived. Why NOT? It is nothing
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.334#more than a moral prejudice that truth is worth more than semblance; it
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.335#is, in fact, the worst proved supposition in the world. So much must be
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.336#conceded: there could have been no life at all except upon the basis
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.337#of perspective estimates and semblances; and if, with the virtuous
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.338#enthusiasm and stupidity of many philosophers, one wished to do away
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.339#altogether with the "seeming world"--well, granted that YOU could do
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.340#that,--at least nothing of your "truth" would thereby remain! Indeed,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.341#what is it that forces us in general to the supposition that there is an
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.342#essential opposition of "true" and "false"? Is it not enough to suppose
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.343#degrees of seemingness, and as it were lighter and darker shades and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.344#tones of semblance--different valeurs, as the painters say? Why might
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.345#not the world WHICH CONCERNS US--be a fiction? And to any one who
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.346#suggested: "But to a fiction belongs an originator?"--might it not be
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.347#bluntly replied: WHY? May not this "belong" also belong to the fiction?
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.348#Is it not at length permitted to be a little ironical towards the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.349#subject, just as towards the predicate and object? Might not the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.350#philosopher elevate himself above faith in grammar? All respect
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.351#to governesses, but is it not time that philosophy should renounce
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.352#governess-faith?
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.353#35. O Voltaire! O humanity! O idiocy! There is something ticklish in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.354#"the truth," and in the SEARCH for the truth; and if man goes about it
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.355#too humanely--"il ne cherche le vrai que pour faire le bien"--I wager he
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.356#finds nothing!
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.357#36. Supposing that nothing else is "given" as real but our world of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.358#desires and passions, that we cannot sink or rise to any other "reality"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.359#but just that of our impulses--for thinking is only a relation of these
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.360#impulses to one another:--are we not permitted to make the attempt and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.361#to ask the question whether this which is "given" does not SUFFICE, by
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.362#means of our counterparts, for the understanding even of the so-called
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.363#mechanical (or "material") world? I do not mean as an illusion, a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.364#"semblance," a "representation" (in the Berkeleyan and Schopenhauerian
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.365#sense), but as possessing the same degree of reality as our emotions
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.366#themselves--as a more primitive form of the world of emotions, in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.367#which everything still lies locked in a mighty unity, which afterwards
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.368#branches off and develops itself in organic processes (naturally also,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.369#refines and debilitates)--as a kind of instinctive life in which all
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.370#organic functions, including self-regulation, assimilation, nutrition,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.371#secretion, and change of matter, are still synthetically united with
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.372#one another--as a PRIMARY FORM of life?--In the end, it is not only
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.373#permitted to make this attempt, it is commanded by the conscience of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.374#LOGICAL METHOD. Not to assume several kinds of causality, so long as
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.375#the attempt to get along with a single one has not been pushed to its
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.376#furthest extent (to absurdity, if I may be allowed to say so): that is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.377#a morality of method which one may not repudiate nowadays--it follows
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.378#"from its definition," as mathematicians say. The question is ultimately
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.379#whether we really recognize the will as OPERATING, whether we believe in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.380#the causality of the will; if we do so--and fundamentally our belief IN
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.381#THIS is just our belief in causality itself--we MUST make the attempt
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.382#to posit hypothetically the causality of the will as the only causality.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.383#"Will" can naturally only operate on "will"--and not on "matter" (not
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.384#on "nerves," for instance): in short, the hypothesis must be
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.385#hazarded, whether will does not operate on will wherever "effects"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.386#are recognized--and whether all mechanical action, inasmuch as a power
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.387#operates therein, is not just the power of will, the effect of will.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.388#Granted, finally, that we succeeded in explaining our entire instinctive
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.389#life as the development and ramification of one fundamental form of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.390#will--namely, the Will to Power, as my thesis puts it; granted that all
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.391#organic functions could be traced back to this Will to Power, and that
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.392#the solution of the problem of generation and nutrition--it is one
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.393#problem--could also be found therein: one would thus have acquired the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.394#right to define ALL active force unequivocally as WILL TO POWER. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.395#world seen from within, the world defined and designated according to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.396#its "intelligible character"--it would simply be "Will to Power," and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.397#nothing else.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.398#37. "What? Does not that mean in popular language: God is disproved, but
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.399#not the devil?"--On the contrary! On the contrary, my friends! And who
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.400#the devil also compels you to speak popularly!
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.401#38. As happened finally in all the enlightenment of modern times with
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.402#the French Revolution (that terrible farce, quite superfluous when
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.403#judged close at hand, into which, however, the noble and visionary
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.404#spectators of all Europe have interpreted from a distance their own
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.405#indignation and enthusiasm so long and passionately, UNTIL THE TEXT HAS
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.406#DISAPPEARED UNDER THE INTERPRETATION), so a noble posterity might once
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.407#more misunderstand the whole of the past, and perhaps only thereby make
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.408#ITS aspect endurable.--Or rather, has not this already happened? Have
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.409#not we ourselves been--that "noble posterity"? And, in so far as we now
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.410#comprehend this, is it not--thereby already past?
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.411#39. Nobody will very readily regard a doctrine as true merely because
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.412#it makes people happy or virtuous--excepting, perhaps, the amiable
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.413#"Idealists," who are enthusiastic about the good, true, and beautiful,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.414#and let all kinds of motley, coarse, and good-natured desirabilities
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.415#swim about promiscuously in their pond. Happiness and virtue are no
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.416#arguments. It is willingly forgotten, however, even on the part of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.417#thoughtful minds, that to make unhappy and to make bad are just as
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.418#little counter-arguments. A thing could be TRUE, although it were in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.419#the highest degree injurious and dangerous; indeed, the fundamental
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.420#constitution of existence might be such that one succumbed by a full
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.421#knowledge of it--so that the strength of a mind might be measured by
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.422#the amount of "truth" it could endure--or to speak more plainly, by the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.423#extent to which it REQUIRED truth attenuated, veiled, sweetened, damped,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.424#and falsified. But there is no doubt that for the discovery of certain
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.425#PORTIONS of truth the wicked and unfortunate are more favourably
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.426#situated and have a greater likelihood of success; not to speak of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.427#wicked who are happy--a species about whom moralists are silent. Perhaps
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.428#severity and craft are more favourable conditions for the development of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.429#strong, independent spirits and philosophers than the gentle, refined,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.430#yielding good-nature, and habit of taking things easily, which are
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.431#prized, and rightly prized in a learned man. Presupposing always,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.432#to begin with, that the term "philosopher" be not confined to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.433#philosopher who writes books, or even introduces HIS philosophy into
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.434#books!--Stendhal furnishes a last feature of the portrait of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.435#free-spirited philosopher, which for the sake of German taste I will
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.436#not omit to underline--for it is OPPOSED to German taste. "Pour etre
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.437#bon philosophe," says this last great psychologist, "il faut etre sec,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.438#clair, sans illusion. Un banquier, qui a fait fortune, a une partie du
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.439#caractere requis pour faire des decouvertes en philosophie, c'est-a-dire
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.440#pour voir clair dans ce qui est."
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.441#40. Everything that is profound loves the mask: the profoundest things
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.442#have a hatred even of figure and likeness. Should not the CONTRARY only
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.443#be the right disguise for the shame of a God to go about in? A question
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.444#worth asking!--it would be strange if some mystic has not already
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.445#ventured on the same kind of thing. There are proceedings of such a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.446#delicate nature that it is well to overwhelm them with coarseness
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.447#and make them unrecognizable; there are actions of love and of an
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.448#extravagant magnanimity after which nothing can be wiser than to take
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.449#a stick and thrash the witness soundly: one thereby obscures his
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.450#recollection. Many a one is able to obscure and abuse his own memory, in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.451#order at least to have vengeance on this sole party in the secret:
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.452#shame is inventive. They are not the worst things of which one is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.453#most ashamed: there is not only deceit behind a mask--there is so much
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.454#goodness in craft. I could imagine that a man with something costly and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.455#fragile to conceal, would roll through life clumsily and rotundly like
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.456#an old, green, heavily-hooped wine-cask: the refinement of his shame
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.457#requiring it to be so. A man who has depths in his shame meets his
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.458#destiny and his delicate decisions upon paths which few ever reach,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.459#and with regard to the existence of which his nearest and most intimate
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.460#friends may be ignorant; his mortal danger conceals itself from their
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.461#eyes, and equally so his regained security. Such a hidden nature,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.462#which instinctively employs speech for silence and concealment, and is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.463#inexhaustible in evasion of communication, DESIRES and insists that a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.464#mask of himself shall occupy his place in the hearts and heads of his
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.465#friends; and supposing he does not desire it, his eyes will some day be
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.466#opened to the fact that there is nevertheless a mask of him there--and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.467#that it is well to be so. Every profound spirit needs a mask; nay, more,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.468#around every profound spirit there continually grows a mask, owing to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.469#the constantly false, that is to say, SUPERFICIAL interpretation
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.470#of every word he utters, every step he takes, every sign of life he
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.471#manifests.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.472#41. One must subject oneself to one's own tests that one is destined
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.473#for independence and command, and do so at the right time. One must not
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.474#avoid one's tests, although they constitute perhaps the most dangerous
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.475#game one can play, and are in the end tests made only before ourselves
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.476#and before no other judge. Not to cleave to any person, be it even the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.477#dearest--every person is a prison and also a recess. Not to cleave to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.478#a fatherland, be it even the most suffering and necessitous--it is even
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.479#less difficult to detach one's heart from a victorious fatherland. Not
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.480#to cleave to a sympathy, be it even for higher men, into whose peculiar
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.481#torture and helplessness chance has given us an insight. Not to cleave
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.482#to a science, though it tempt one with the most valuable discoveries,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.483#apparently specially reserved for us. Not to cleave to one's own
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.484#liberation, to the voluptuous distance and remoteness of the bird, which
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.485#always flies further aloft in order always to see more under it--the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.486#danger of the flier. Not to cleave to our own virtues, nor become as
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.487#a whole a victim to any of our specialties, to our "hospitality" for
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.488#instance, which is the danger of dangers for highly developed
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.489#and wealthy souls, who deal prodigally, almost indifferently with
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.490#themselves, and push the virtue of liberality so far that it becomes
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.491#a vice. One must know how TO CONSERVE ONESELF--the best test of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.492#independence.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.493#42. A new order of philosophers is appearing; I shall venture to baptize
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.494#them by a name not without danger. As far as I understand them, as far
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.495#as they allow themselves to be understood--for it is their nature to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.496#WISH to remain something of a puzzle--these philosophers of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.497#future might rightly, perhaps also wrongly, claim to be designated as
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.498#"tempters." This name itself is after all only an attempt, or, if it be
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.499#preferred, a temptation.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.500#43. Will they be new friends of "truth," these coming philosophers? Very
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.501#probably, for all philosophers hitherto have loved their truths. But
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.502#assuredly they will not be dogmatists. It must be contrary to their
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.503#pride, and also contrary to their taste, that their truth should still
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.504#be truth for every one--that which has hitherto been the secret wish
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.505#and ultimate purpose of all dogmatic efforts. "My opinion is MY opinion:
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.506#another person has not easily a right to it"--such a philosopher of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.507#future will say, perhaps. One must renounce the bad taste of wishing to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.508#agree with many people. "Good" is no longer good when one's neighbour
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.509#takes it into his mouth. And how could there be a "common good"! The
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.510#expression contradicts itself; that which can be common is always of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.511#small value. In the end things must be as they are and have always
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.512#been--the great things remain for the great, the abysses for the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.513#profound, the delicacies and thrills for the refined, and, to sum up
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.514#shortly, everything rare for the rare.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.515#44. Need I say expressly after all this that they will be free, VERY
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.516#free spirits, these philosophers of the future--as certainly also they
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.517#will not be merely free spirits, but something more, higher, greater,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.518#and fundamentally different, which does not wish to be misunderstood and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.519#mistaken? But while I say this, I feel under OBLIGATION almost as much
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.520#to them as to ourselves (we free spirits who are their heralds and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.521#forerunners), to sweep away from ourselves altogether a stupid old
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.522#prejudice and misunderstanding, which, like a fog, has too long made the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.523#conception of "free spirit" obscure. In every country of Europe, and the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.524#same in America, there is at present something which makes an abuse of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.525#this name a very narrow, prepossessed, enchained class of spirits,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.526#who desire almost the opposite of what our intentions and instincts
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.527#prompt--not to mention that in respect to the NEW philosophers who are
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.528#appearing, they must still more be closed windows and bolted doors.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.529#Briefly and regrettably, they belong to the LEVELLERS, these wrongly
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.530#named "free spirits"--as glib-tongued and scribe-fingered slaves of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.531#the democratic taste and its "modern ideas" all of them men without
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.532#solitude, without personal solitude, blunt honest fellows to whom
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.533#neither courage nor honourable conduct ought to be denied, only, they
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.534#are not free, and are ludicrously superficial, especially in their
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.535#innate partiality for seeing the cause of almost ALL human misery and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.536#failure in the old forms in which society has hitherto existed--a notion
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.537#which happily inverts the truth entirely! What they would fain attain
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.538#with all their strength, is the universal, green-meadow happiness of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.539#herd, together with security, safety, comfort, and alleviation of life
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.540#for every one, their two most frequently chanted songs and doctrines
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.541#are called "Equality of Rights" and "Sympathy with All Sufferers"--and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.542#suffering itself is looked upon by them as something which must be
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.543#DONE AWAY WITH. We opposite ones, however, who have opened our eye and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.544#conscience to the question how and where the plant "man" has hitherto
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.545#grown most vigorously, believe that this has always taken place under
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.546#the opposite conditions, that for this end the dangerousness of his
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.547#situation had to be increased enormously, his inventive faculty and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.548#dissembling power (his "spirit") had to develop into subtlety and daring
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.549#under long oppression and compulsion, and his Will to Life had to be
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.550#increased to the unconditioned Will to Power--we believe that severity,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.551#violence, slavery, danger in the street and in the heart, secrecy,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.552#stoicism, tempter's art and devilry of every kind,--that everything
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.553#wicked, terrible, tyrannical, predatory, and serpentine in man, serves
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.554#as well for the elevation of the human species as its opposite--we do
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.555#not even say enough when we only say THIS MUCH, and in any case we
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.556#find ourselves here, both with our speech and our silence, at the OTHER
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.557#extreme of all modern ideology and gregarious desirability, as their
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.558#antipodes perhaps? What wonder that we "free spirits" are not exactly
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.559#the most communicative spirits? that we do not wish to betray in every
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.560#respect WHAT a spirit can free itself from, and WHERE perhaps it will
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.561#then be driven? And as to the import of the dangerous formula, "Beyond
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.562#Good and Evil," with which we at least avoid confusion, we ARE something
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.563#else than "libres-penseurs," "liben pensatori" "free-thinkers,"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.564#and whatever these honest advocates of "modern ideas" like to call
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.565#themselves. Having been at home, or at least guests, in many realms of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.566#the spirit, having escaped again and again from the gloomy, agreeable
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.567#nooks in which preferences and prejudices, youth, origin, the accident
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.568#of men and books, or even the weariness of travel seemed to confine us,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.569#full of malice against the seductions of dependency which he concealed
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.570#in honours, money, positions, or exaltation of the senses, grateful even
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.571#for distress and the vicissitudes of illness, because they always free
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.572#us from some rule, and its "prejudice," grateful to the God, devil,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.573#sheep, and worm in us, inquisitive to a fault, investigators to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.574#point of cruelty, with unhesitating fingers for the intangible, with
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.575#teeth and stomachs for the most indigestible, ready for any business
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.576#that requires sagacity and acute senses, ready for every adventure,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.577#owing to an excess of "free will", with anterior and posterior souls,

urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.579#foregrounds and backgrounds to the end of which no foot may run, hidden
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.580#ones under the mantles of light, appropriators, although we resemble
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.581#heirs and spendthrifts, arrangers and collectors from morning till
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.582#night, misers of our wealth and our full-crammed drawers, economical
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.583#in learning and forgetting, inventive in scheming, sometimes proud of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.584#tables of categories, sometimes pedants, sometimes night-owls of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.585#work even in full day, yea, if necessary, even scarecrows--and it is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.586#necessary nowadays, that is to say, inasmuch as we are the born, sworn,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.587#jealous friends of SOLITUDE, of our own profoundest midnight and midday
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.588#solitude--such kind of men are we, we free spirits! And perhaps ye are
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:2.589#also something of the same kind, ye coming ones? ye NEW philosophers?
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.1#CHAPTER III. THE RELIGIOUS MOOD
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.2#45. The human soul and its limits, the range of man's inner experiences
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.3#hitherto attained, the heights, depths, and distances of these
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.4#experiences, the entire history of the soul UP TO THE PRESENT TIME,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.5#and its still unexhausted possibilities: this is the preordained
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.6#hunting-domain for a born psychologist and lover of a "big hunt". But
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.7#how often must he say despairingly to himself: "A single individual!
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.8#alas, only a single individual! and this great forest, this virgin
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.9#forest!" So he would like to have some hundreds of hunting assistants,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.10#and fine trained hounds, that he could send into the history of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.11#human soul, to drive HIS game together. In vain: again and again he
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.12#experiences, profoundly and bitterly, how difficult it is to find
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.13#assistants and dogs for all the things that directly excite his
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.14#curiosity. The evil of sending scholars into new and dangerous
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.15#hunting-domains, where courage, sagacity, and subtlety in every sense
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.16#are required, is that they are no longer serviceable just when the "BIG
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.17#hunt," and also the great danger commences,--it is precisely then that
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.18#they lose their keen eye and nose. In order, for instance, to divine and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.19#determine what sort of history the problem of KNOWLEDGE AND CONSCIENCE
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.20#has hitherto had in the souls of homines religiosi, a person would
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.21#perhaps himself have to possess as profound, as bruised, as immense an
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.22#experience as the intellectual conscience of Pascal; and then he would
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.23#still require that wide-spread heaven of clear, wicked spirituality,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.24#which, from above, would be able to oversee, arrange, and effectively
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.25#formulize this mass of dangerous and painful experiences.--But who
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.26#could do me this service! And who would have time to wait for such
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.27#servants!--they evidently appear too rarely, they are so improbable at
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.28#all times! Eventually one must do everything ONESELF in order to know
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.29#something; which means that one has MUCH to do!--But a curiosity like
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.30#mine is once for all the most agreeable of vices--pardon me! I mean to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.31#say that the love of truth has its reward in heaven, and already upon
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.32#earth.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.33#46. Faith, such as early Christianity desired, and not infrequently
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.34#achieved in the midst of a skeptical and southernly free-spirited world,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.35#which had centuries of struggle between philosophical schools behind
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.36#it and in it, counting besides the education in tolerance which
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.37#the Imperium Romanum gave--this faith is NOT that sincere, austere
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.38#slave-faith by which perhaps a Luther or a Cromwell, or some other
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.39#northern barbarian of the spirit remained attached to his God and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.40#Christianity, it is much rather the faith of Pascal, which resembles in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.41#a terrible manner a continuous suicide of reason--a tough, long-lived,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.42#worm-like reason, which is not to be slain at once and with a single
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.43#blow. The Christian faith from the beginning, is sacrifice the sacrifice
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.44#of all freedom, all pride, all self-confidence of spirit, it is at
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.45#the same time subjection, self-derision, and self-mutilation. There is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.46#cruelty and religious Phoenicianism in this faith, which is adapted to a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.47#tender, many-sided, and very fastidious conscience, it takes for granted
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.48#that the subjection of the spirit is indescribably PAINFUL, that all the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.49#past and all the habits of such a spirit resist the absurdissimum, in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.50#the form of which "faith" comes to it. Modern men, with their obtuseness
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.51#as regards all Christian nomenclature, have no longer the sense for the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.52#terribly superlative conception which was implied to an antique taste by
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.53#the paradox of the formula, "God on the Cross". Hitherto there had never
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.54#and nowhere been such boldness in inversion, nor anything at once so
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.55#dreadful, questioning, and questionable as this formula: it promised a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.56#transvaluation of all ancient values--It was the Orient, the PROFOUND
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.57#Orient, it was the Oriental slave who thus took revenge on Rome and its
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.58#noble, light-minded toleration, on the Roman "Catholicism" of non-faith,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.59#and it was always not the faith, but the freedom from the faith, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.60#half-stoical and smiling indifference to the seriousness of the faith,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.61#which made the slaves indignant at their masters and revolt against
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.62#them. "Enlightenment" causes revolt, for the slave desires the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.63#unconditioned, he understands nothing but the tyrannous, even in morals,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.64#he loves as he hates, without NUANCE, to the very depths, to the point
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.65#of pain, to the point of sickness--his many HIDDEN sufferings make
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.66#him revolt against the noble taste which seems to DENY suffering. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.67#skepticism with regard to suffering, fundamentally only an attitude of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.68#aristocratic morality, was not the least of the causes, also, of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.69#last great slave-insurrection which began with the French Revolution.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.70#47. Wherever the religious neurosis has appeared on the earth so far,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.71#we find it connected with three dangerous prescriptions as to regimen:
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.72#solitude, fasting, and sexual abstinence--but without its being possible
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.73#to determine with certainty which is cause and which is effect, or IF
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.74#any relation at all of cause and effect exists there. This latter doubt
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.75#is justified by the fact that one of the most regular symptoms among
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.76#savage as well as among civilized peoples is the most sudden and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.77#excessive sensuality, which then with equal suddenness transforms into
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.78#penitential paroxysms, world-renunciation, and will-renunciation, both
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.79#symptoms perhaps explainable as disguised epilepsy? But nowhere is it
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.80#MORE obligatory to put aside explanations around no other type has there
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.81#grown such a mass of absurdity and superstition, no other type seems to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.82#have been more interesting to men and even to philosophers--perhaps it
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.83#is time to become just a little indifferent here, to learn caution, or,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.84#better still, to look AWAY, TO GO AWAY--Yet in the background of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.85#most recent philosophy, that of Schopenhauer, we find almost as the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.86#problem in itself, this terrible note of interrogation of the religious
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.87#crisis and awakening. How is the negation of will POSSIBLE? how is the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.88#saint possible?--that seems to have been the very question with which
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.89#Schopenhauer made a start and became a philosopher. And thus it was a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.90#genuine Schopenhauerian consequence, that his most convinced adherent
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.91#(perhaps also his last, as far as Germany is concerned), namely, Richard
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.92#Wagner, should bring his own life-work to an end just here, and should
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.93#finally put that terrible and eternal type upon the stage as Kundry,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.94#type vecu, and as it loved and lived, at the very time that the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.95#mad-doctors in almost all European countries had an opportunity to study
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.96#the type close at hand, wherever the religious neurosis--or as I call
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.97#it, "the religious mood"--made its latest epidemical outbreak and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.98#display as the "Salvation Army"--If it be a question, however, as to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.99#what has been so extremely interesting to men of all sorts in all ages,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.100#and even to philosophers, in the whole phenomenon of the saint, it
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.101#is undoubtedly the appearance of the miraculous therein--namely, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.102#immediate SUCCESSION OF OPPOSITES, of states of the soul regarded as
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.103#morally antithetical: it was believed here to be self-evident that
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.104#a "bad man" was all at once turned into a "saint," a good man. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.105#hitherto existing psychology was wrecked at this point, is it not
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.106#possible it may have happened principally because psychology had placed
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.107#itself under the dominion of morals, because it BELIEVED in oppositions
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.108#of moral values, and saw, read, and INTERPRETED these oppositions
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.109#into the text and facts of the case? What? "Miracle" only an error of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.110#interpretation? A lack of philology?
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.111#48. It seems that the Latin races are far more deeply attached to their
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.112#Catholicism than we Northerners are to Christianity generally, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.113#that consequently unbelief in Catholic countries means something quite
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.114#different from what it does among Protestants--namely, a sort of revolt
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.115#against the spirit of the race, while with us it is rather a return to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.116#the spirit (or non-spirit) of the race.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.117#We Northerners undoubtedly derive our origin from barbarous races, even
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.118#as regards our talents for religion--we have POOR talents for it. One
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.119#may make an exception in the case of the Celts, who have theretofore
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.120#furnished also the best soil for Christian infection in the North: the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.121#Christian ideal blossomed forth in France as much as ever the pale sun
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.122#of the north would allow it. How strangely pious for our taste are still
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.123#these later French skeptics, whenever there is any Celtic blood in their
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.124#origin! How Catholic, how un-German does Auguste Comte's Sociology
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.125#seem to us, with the Roman logic of its instincts! How Jesuitical, that
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.126#amiable and shrewd cicerone of Port Royal, Sainte-Beuve, in spite of all
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.127#his hostility to Jesuits! And even Ernest Renan: how inaccessible to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.128#us Northerners does the language of such a Renan appear, in whom
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.129#every instant the merest touch of religious thrill throws his refined
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.130#voluptuous and comfortably couching soul off its balance! Let us repeat
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.131#after him these fine sentences--and what wickedness and haughtiness is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.132#immediately aroused by way of answer in our probably less beautiful but
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.133#harder souls, that is to say, in our more German souls!--"DISONS DONC
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.134#HARDIMENT QUE LA RELIGION EST UN PRODUIT DE L'HOMME NORMAL, QUE L'HOMME

urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.140#L'HOMME VOIT LE MIEUX?"... These sentences are so extremely ANTIPODAL
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.141#to my ears and habits of thought, that in my first impulse of rage
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.142#on finding them, I wrote on the margin, "LA NIAISERIE RELIGIEUSE PAR
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.143#EXCELLENCE!"--until in my later rage I even took a fancy to them, these
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.144#sentences with their truth absolutely inverted! It is so nice and such a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.145#distinction to have one's own antipodes!
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.146#49. That which is so astonishing in the religious life of the ancient
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.147#Greeks is the irrestrainable stream of GRATITUDE which it pours
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.148#forth--it is a very superior kind of man who takes SUCH an attitude
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.149#towards nature and life.--Later on, when the populace got the upper hand
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.150#in Greece, FEAR became rampant also in religion; and Christianity was
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.151#preparing itself.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.152#50. The passion for God: there are churlish, honest-hearted, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.153#importunate kinds of it, like that of Luther--the whole of Protestantism
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.154#lacks the southern DELICATEZZA. There is an Oriental exaltation of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.155#mind in it, like that of an undeservedly favoured or elevated slave, as
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.156#in the case of St. Augustine, for instance, who lacks in an offensive
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.157#manner, all nobility in bearing and desires. There is a feminine
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.158#tenderness and sensuality in it, which modestly and unconsciously longs
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.159#for a UNIO MYSTICA ET PHYSICA, as in the case of Madame de Guyon. In
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.160#many cases it appears, curiously enough, as the disguise of a girl's
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.161#or youth's puberty; here and there even as the hysteria of an old maid,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.162#also as her last ambition. The Church has frequently canonized the woman
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.163#in such a case.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.164#51. The mightiest men have hitherto always bowed reverently before
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.165#the saint, as the enigma of self-subjugation and utter voluntary
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.166#privation--why did they thus bow? They divined in him--and as it were
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.167#behind the questionableness of his frail and wretched appearance--the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.168#superior force which wished to test itself by such a subjugation; the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.169#strength of will, in which they recognized their own strength and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.170#love of power, and knew how to honour it: they honoured something
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.171#in themselves when they honoured the saint. In addition to this, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.172#contemplation of the saint suggested to them a suspicion: such an
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.173#enormity of self-negation and anti-naturalness will not have been
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.174#coveted for nothing--they have said, inquiringly. There is perhaps a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.175#reason for it, some very great danger, about which the ascetic might
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.176#wish to be more accurately informed through his secret interlocutors and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.177#visitors? In a word, the mighty ones of the world learned to have a new
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.178#fear before him, they divined a new power, a strange, still unconquered
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.179#enemy:--it was the "Will to Power" which obliged them to halt before the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.180#saint. They had to question him.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.181#52. In the Jewish "Old Testament," the book of divine justice, there are
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.182#men, things, and sayings on such an immense scale, that Greek and Indian
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.183#literature has nothing to compare with it. One stands with fear and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.184#reverence before those stupendous remains of what man was formerly, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.185#one has sad thoughts about old Asia and its little out-pushed peninsula
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.186#Europe, which would like, by all means, to figure before Asia as the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.187#"Progress of Mankind." To be sure, he who is himself only a slender,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.188#tame house-animal, and knows only the wants of a house-animal (like
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.189#our cultured people of today, including the Christians of "cultured"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.190#Christianity), need neither be amazed nor even sad amid those ruins--the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.191#taste for the Old Testament is a touchstone with respect to "great" and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.192#"small": perhaps he will find that the New Testament, the book of grace,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.193#still appeals more to his heart (there is much of the odour of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.194#genuine, tender, stupid beadsman and petty soul in it). To have bound
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.195#up this New Testament (a kind of ROCOCO of taste in every respect) along
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.196#with the Old Testament into one book, as the "Bible," as "The Book in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.197#Itself," is perhaps the greatest audacity and "sin against the Spirit"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.198#which literary Europe has upon its conscience.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.199#53. Why Atheism nowadays? "The father" in God is thoroughly refuted;
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.200#equally so "the judge," "the rewarder." Also his "free will": he does
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.201#not hear--and even if he did, he would not know how to help. The worst
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.202#is that he seems incapable of communicating himself clearly; is he
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.203#uncertain?--This is what I have made out (by questioning and listening
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.204#at a variety of conversations) to be the cause of the decline of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.205#European theism; it appears to me that though the religious instinct is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.206#in vigorous growth,--it rejects the theistic satisfaction with profound
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.207#distrust.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.208#54. What does all modern philosophy mainly do? Since Descartes--and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.209#indeed more in defiance of him than on the basis of his procedure--an
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.210#ATTENTAT has been made on the part of all philosophers on the old
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.211#conception of the soul, under the guise of a criticism of the subject
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.212#and predicate conception--that is to say, an ATTENTAT on the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.213#fundamental presupposition of Christian doctrine. Modern philosophy,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.214#as epistemological skepticism, is secretly or openly ANTI-CHRISTIAN,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.215#although (for keener ears, be it said) by no means anti-religious.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.216#Formerly, in effect, one believed in "the soul" as one believed in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.217#grammar and the grammatical subject: one said, "I" is the condition,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.218#"think" is the predicate and is conditioned--to think is an activity for
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.219#which one MUST suppose a subject as cause. The attempt was then made,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.220#with marvelous tenacity and subtlety, to see if one could not get out
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.221#of this net,--to see if the opposite was not perhaps true: "think" the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.222#condition, and "I" the conditioned; "I," therefore, only a synthesis
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.223#which has been MADE by thinking itself. KANT really wished to prove
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.224#that, starting from the subject, the subject could not be proved--nor
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.225#the object either: the possibility of an APPARENT EXISTENCE of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.226#subject, and therefore of "the soul," may not always have been strange
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.227#to him,--the thought which once had an immense power on earth as the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.228#Vedanta philosophy.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.229#55. There is a great ladder of religious cruelty, with many rounds; but
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.230#three of these are the most important. Once on a time men sacrificed
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.231#human beings to their God, and perhaps just those they loved the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.232#best--to this category belong the firstling sacrifices of all primitive
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.233#religions, and also the sacrifice of the Emperor Tiberius in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.234#Mithra-Grotto on the Island of Capri, that most terrible of all Roman
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.235#anachronisms. Then, during the moral epoch of mankind, they sacrificed
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.236#to their God the strongest instincts they possessed, their "nature";
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.237#THIS festal joy shines in the cruel glances of ascetics and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.238#"anti-natural" fanatics. Finally, what still remained to be sacrificed?
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.239#Was it not necessary in the end for men to sacrifice everything
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.240#comforting, holy, healing, all hope, all faith in hidden harmonies, in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.241#future blessedness and justice? Was it not necessary to sacrifice God
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.242#himself, and out of cruelty to themselves to worship stone, stupidity,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.243#gravity, fate, nothingness? To sacrifice God for nothingness--this
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.244#paradoxical mystery of the ultimate cruelty has been reserved for the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.245#rising generation; we all know something thereof already.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.246#56. Whoever, like myself, prompted by some enigmatical desire, has long
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.247#endeavoured to go to the bottom of the question of pessimism and free it
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.248#from the half-Christian, half-German narrowness and stupidity in which
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.249#it has finally presented itself to this century, namely, in the form of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.250#Schopenhauer's philosophy; whoever, with an Asiatic and super-Asiatic
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.251#eye, has actually looked inside, and into the most world-renouncing of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.252#all possible modes of thought--beyond good and evil, and no longer
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.253#like Buddha and Schopenhauer, under the dominion and delusion of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.254#morality,--whoever has done this, has perhaps just thereby, without
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.255#really desiring it, opened his eyes to behold the opposite ideal: the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.256#ideal of the most world-approving, exuberant, and vivacious man, who has
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.257#not only learnt to compromise and arrange with that which was and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.258#is, but wishes to have it again AS IT WAS AND IS, for all eternity,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.259#insatiably calling out da capo, not only to himself, but to the whole
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.260#piece and play; and not only the play, but actually to him who requires
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.261#the play--and makes it necessary; because he always requires
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.262#himself anew--and makes himself necessary.--What? And this would not
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.263#be--circulus vitiosus deus?
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.264#57. The distance, and as it were the space around man, grows with the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.265#strength of his intellectual vision and insight: his world becomes
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.266#profounder; new stars, new enigmas, and notions are ever coming into
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.267#view. Perhaps everything on which the intellectual eye has exercised
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.268#its acuteness and profundity has just been an occasion for its exercise,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.269#something of a game, something for children and childish minds. Perhaps
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.270#the most solemn conceptions that have caused the most fighting and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.271#suffering, the conceptions "God" and "sin," will one day seem to us of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.272#no more importance than a child's plaything or a child's pain seems to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.273#an old man;--and perhaps another plaything and another pain will then
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.274#be necessary once more for "the old man"--always childish enough, an
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.275#eternal child!
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.276#58. Has it been observed to what extent outward idleness, or
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.277#semi-idleness, is necessary to a real religious life (alike for its
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.278#favourite microscopic labour of self-examination, and for its soft
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.279#placidity called "prayer," the state of perpetual readiness for the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.280#"coming of God"), I mean the idleness with a good conscience, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.281#idleness of olden times and of blood, to which the aristocratic
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.282#sentiment that work is DISHONOURING--that it vulgarizes body and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.283#soul--is not quite unfamiliar? And that consequently the modern, noisy,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.284#time-engrossing, conceited, foolishly proud laboriousness educates
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.285#and prepares for "unbelief" more than anything else? Among these, for
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.286#instance, who are at present living apart from religion in Germany, I
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.287#find "free-thinkers" of diversified species and origin, but above all
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.288#a majority of those in whom laboriousness from generation to generation
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.289#has dissolved the religious instincts; so that they no longer know what
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.290#purpose religions serve, and only note their existence in the world
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.291#with a kind of dull astonishment. They feel themselves already fully
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.292#occupied, these good people, be it by their business or by their
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.293#pleasures, not to mention the "Fatherland," and the newspapers, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.294#their "family duties"; it seems that they have no time whatever left
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.295#for religion; and above all, it is not obvious to them whether it is a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.296#question of a new business or a new pleasure--for it is impossible, they
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.297#say to themselves, that people should go to church merely to spoil
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.298#their tempers. They are by no means enemies of religious customs;
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.299#should certain circumstances, State affairs perhaps, require their
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.300#participation in such customs, they do what is required, as so many
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.301#things are done--with a patient and unassuming seriousness, and without
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.302#much curiosity or discomfort;--they live too much apart and outside
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.303#to feel even the necessity for a FOR or AGAINST in such matters. Among
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.304#those indifferent persons may be reckoned nowadays the majority of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.305#German Protestants of the middle classes, especially in the great
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.306#laborious centres of trade and commerce; also the majority of laborious
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.307#scholars, and the entire University personnel (with the exception of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.308#the theologians, whose existence and possibility there always gives
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.309#psychologists new and more subtle puzzles to solve). On the part of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.310#pious, or merely church-going people, there is seldom any idea of HOW
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.311#MUCH good-will, one might say arbitrary will, is now necessary for a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.312#German scholar to take the problem of religion seriously; his whole
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.313#profession (and as I have said, his whole workmanlike laboriousness, to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.314#which he is compelled by his modern conscience) inclines him to a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.315#lofty and almost charitable serenity as regards religion, with which is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.316#occasionally mingled a slight disdain for the "uncleanliness" of spirit
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.317#which he takes for granted wherever any one still professes to belong
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.318#to the Church. It is only with the help of history (NOT through his own
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.319#personal experience, therefore) that the scholar succeeds in bringing
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.320#himself to a respectful seriousness, and to a certain timid deference
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.321#in presence of religions; but even when his sentiments have reached the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.322#stage of gratitude towards them, he has not personally advanced one
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.323#step nearer to that which still maintains itself as Church or as piety;
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.324#perhaps even the contrary. The practical indifference to religious
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.325#matters in the midst of which he has been born and brought up, usually
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.326#sublimates itself in his case into circumspection and cleanliness, which
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.327#shuns contact with religious men and things; and it may be just the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.328#depth of his tolerance and humanity which prompts him to avoid the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.329#delicate trouble which tolerance itself brings with it.--Every age has
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.330#its own divine type of naivete, for the discovery of which other ages
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.331#may envy it: and how much naivete--adorable, childlike, and boundlessly
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.332#foolish naivete is involved in this belief of the scholar in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.333#his superiority, in the good conscience of his tolerance, in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.334#unsuspecting, simple certainty with which his instinct treats the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.335#religious man as a lower and less valuable type, beyond, before, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.336#ABOVE which he himself has developed--he, the little arrogant dwarf
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.337#and mob-man, the sedulously alert, head-and-hand drudge of "ideas," of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.338#"modern ideas"!
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.339#59. Whoever has seen deeply into the world has doubtless divined what
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.340#wisdom there is in the fact that men are superficial. It is their
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.341#preservative instinct which teaches them to be flighty, lightsome, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.342#false. Here and there one finds a passionate and exaggerated adoration
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.343#of "pure forms" in philosophers as well as in artists: it is not to be
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.344#doubted that whoever has NEED of the cult of the superficial to that
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.345#extent, has at one time or another made an unlucky dive BENEATH it.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.346#Perhaps there is even an order of rank with respect to those burnt
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.347#children, the born artists who find the enjoyment of life only in trying
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.348#to FALSIFY its image (as if taking wearisome revenge on it), one might
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.349#guess to what degree life has disgusted them, by the extent to which
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.350#they wish to see its image falsified, attenuated, ultrified, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.351#deified,--one might reckon the homines religiosi among the artists, as
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.352#their HIGHEST rank. It is the profound, suspicious fear of an incurable
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.353#pessimism which compels whole centuries to fasten their teeth into a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.354#religious interpretation of existence: the fear of the instinct which
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.355#divines that truth might be attained TOO soon, before man has become
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.356#strong enough, hard enough, artist enough.... Piety, the "Life in God,"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.357#regarded in this light, would appear as the most elaborate and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.358#ultimate product of the FEAR of truth, as artist-adoration
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.359#and artist-intoxication in presence of the most logical of all
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.360#falsifications, as the will to the inversion of truth, to untruth at
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.361#any price. Perhaps there has hitherto been no more effective means of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.362#beautifying man than piety, by means of it man can become so artful, so
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.363#superficial, so iridescent, and so good, that his appearance no longer
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.364#offends.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.365#60. To love mankind FOR GOD'S SAKE--this has so far been the noblest and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.366#remotest sentiment to which mankind has attained. That love to mankind,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.367#without any redeeming intention in the background, is only an ADDITIONAL
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.368#folly and brutishness, that the inclination to this love has first to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.369#get its proportion, its delicacy, its gram of salt and sprinkling
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.370#of ambergris from a higher inclination--whoever first perceived
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.371#and "experienced" this, however his tongue may have stammered as it
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.372#attempted to express such a delicate matter, let him for all time be
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.373#holy and respected, as the man who has so far flown highest and gone
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.374#astray in the finest fashion!
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.375#61. The philosopher, as WE free spirits understand him--as the man of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.376#the greatest responsibility, who has the conscience for the general
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.377#development of mankind,--will use religion for his disciplining and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.378#educating work, just as he will use the contemporary political
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.379#and economic conditions. The selecting and disciplining
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.380#influence--destructive, as well as creative and fashioning--which can be
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.381#exercised by means of religion is manifold and varied, according to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.382#sort of people placed under its spell and protection. For those who are
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.383#strong and independent, destined and trained to command, in whom the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.384#judgment and skill of a ruling race is incorporated, religion is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.385#an additional means for overcoming resistance in the exercise of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.386#authority--as a bond which binds rulers and subjects in common,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.387#betraying and surrendering to the former the conscience of the latter,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.388#their inmost heart, which would fain escape obedience. And in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.389#case of the unique natures of noble origin, if by virtue of superior
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.390#spirituality they should incline to a more retired and contemplative
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.391#life, reserving to themselves only the more refined forms of government
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.392#(over chosen disciples or members of an order), religion itself may
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.393#be used as a means for obtaining peace from the noise and trouble of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.394#managing GROSSER affairs, and for securing immunity from the UNAVOIDABLE
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.395#filth of all political agitation. The Brahmins, for instance, understood
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.396#this fact. With the help of a religious organization, they secured to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.397#themselves the power of nominating kings for the people, while their
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.398#sentiments prompted them to keep apart and outside, as men with a higher
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.399#and super-regal mission. At the same time religion gives inducement and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.400#opportunity to some of the subjects to qualify themselves for future
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.401#ruling and commanding the slowly ascending ranks and classes, in which,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.402#through fortunate marriage customs, volitional power and delight in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.403#self-control are on the increase. To them religion offers sufficient
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.404#incentives and temptations to aspire to higher intellectuality, and to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.405#experience the sentiments of authoritative self-control, of silence, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.406#of solitude. Asceticism and Puritanism are almost indispensable means of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.407#educating and ennobling a race which seeks to rise above its hereditary
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.408#baseness and work itself upwards to future supremacy. And finally, to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.409#ordinary men, to the majority of the people, who exist for service and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.410#general utility, and are only so far entitled to exist, religion gives
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.411#invaluable contentedness with their lot and condition, peace of heart,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.412#ennoblement of obedience, additional social happiness and sympathy,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.413#with something of transfiguration and embellishment, something of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.414#justification of all the commonplaceness, all the meanness, all
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.415#the semi-animal poverty of their souls. Religion, together with the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.416#religious significance of life, sheds sunshine over such perpetually
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.417#harassed men, and makes even their own aspect endurable to them, it
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.418#operates upon them as the Epicurean philosophy usually operates upon
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.419#sufferers of a higher order, in a refreshing and refining manner,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.420#almost TURNING suffering TO ACCOUNT, and in the end even hallowing and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.421#vindicating it. There is perhaps nothing so admirable in Christianity
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.422#and Buddhism as their art of teaching even the lowest to elevate
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.423#themselves by piety to a seemingly higher order of things, and thereby
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.424#to retain their satisfaction with the actual world in which they find it
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.425#difficult enough to live--this very difficulty being necessary.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.426#62. To be sure--to make also the bad counter-reckoning against such
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.427#religions, and to bring to light their secret dangers--the cost is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.428#always excessive and terrible when religions do NOT operate as an
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.429#educational and disciplinary medium in the hands of the philosopher, but
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.430#rule voluntarily and PARAMOUNTLY, when they wish to be the final end,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.431#and not a means along with other means. Among men, as among all other
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.432#animals, there is a surplus of defective, diseased, degenerating,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.433#infirm, and necessarily suffering individuals; the successful cases,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.434#among men also, are always the exception; and in view of the fact that
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.435#man is THE ANIMAL NOT YET PROPERLY ADAPTED TO HIS ENVIRONMENT, the rare
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.436#exception. But worse still. The higher the type a man represents, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.437#greater is the improbability that he will SUCCEED; the accidental, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.438#law of irrationality in the general constitution of mankind, manifests
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.439#itself most terribly in its destructive effect on the higher orders of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.440#men, the conditions of whose lives are delicate, diverse, and difficult
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.441#to determine. What, then, is the attitude of the two greatest religions
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.442#above-mentioned to the SURPLUS of failures in life? They endeavour
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.443#to preserve and keep alive whatever can be preserved; in fact, as the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.444#religions FOR SUFFERERS, they take the part of these upon principle;
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.445#they are always in favour of those who suffer from life as from a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.446#disease, and they would fain treat every other experience of life as
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.447#false and impossible. However highly we may esteem this indulgent and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.448#preservative care (inasmuch as in applying to others, it has applied,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.449#and applies also to the highest and usually the most suffering type of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.450#man), the hitherto PARAMOUNT religions--to give a general appreciation
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.451#of them--are among the principal causes which have kept the type of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.452#"man" upon a lower level--they have preserved too much THAT WHICH SHOULD
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.453#HAVE PERISHED. One has to thank them for invaluable services; and who is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.454#sufficiently rich in gratitude not to feel poor at the contemplation
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.455#of all that the "spiritual men" of Christianity have done for Europe
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.456#hitherto! But when they had given comfort to the sufferers, courage to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.457#the oppressed and despairing, a staff and support to the helpless,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.458#and when they had allured from society into convents and spiritual
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.459#penitentiaries the broken-hearted and distracted: what else had they
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.460#to do in order to work systematically in that fashion, and with a good
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.461#conscience, for the preservation of all the sick and suffering, which
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.462#means, in deed and in truth, to work for the DETERIORATION OF THE
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.463#EUROPEAN RACE? To REVERSE all estimates of value--THAT is what they
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.464#had to do! And to shatter the strong, to spoil great hopes, to cast
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.465#suspicion on the delight in beauty, to break down everything autonomous,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.466#manly, conquering, and imperious--all instincts which are natural to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.467#highest and most successful type of "man"--into uncertainty, distress
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.468#of conscience, and self-destruction; forsooth, to invert all love of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.469#earthly and of supremacy over the earth, into hatred of the earth and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.470#earthly things--THAT is the task the Church imposed on itself, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.471#was obliged to impose, until, according to its standard of value,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.472#"unworldliness," "unsensuousness," and "higher man" fused into one
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.473#sentiment. If one could observe the strangely painful, equally coarse
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.474#and refined comedy of European Christianity with the derisive and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.475#impartial eye of an Epicurean god, I should think one would never cease
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.476#marvelling and laughing; does it not actually seem that some single will
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.477#has ruled over Europe for eighteen centuries in order to make a SUBLIME
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.478#ABORTION of man? He, however, who, with opposite requirements (no longer
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.479#Epicurean) and with some divine hammer in his hand, could approach this
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.480#almost voluntary degeneration and stunting of mankind, as exemplified in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.481#the European Christian (Pascal, for instance), would he not have to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.482#cry aloud with rage, pity, and horror: "Oh, you bunglers, presumptuous
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.483#pitiful bunglers, what have you done! Was that a work for your hands?
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.484#How you have hacked and botched my finest stone! What have you presumed
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.485#to do!"--I should say that Christianity has hitherto been the most
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.486#portentous of presumptions. Men, not great enough, nor hard enough,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.487#to be entitled as artists to take part in fashioning MAN; men,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.488#not sufficiently strong and far-sighted to ALLOW, with sublime
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.489#self-constraint, the obvious law of the thousandfold failures and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.490#perishings to prevail; men, not sufficiently noble to see the radically
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.491#different grades of rank and intervals of rank that separate man from
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.492#man:--SUCH men, with their "equality before God," have hitherto swayed
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.493#the destiny of Europe; until at last a dwarfed, almost ludicrous species
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.494#has been produced, a gregarious animal, something obliging, sickly,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:3.495#mediocre, the European of the present day.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.1#CHAPTER IV. APOPHTHEGMS AND INTERLUDES
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.2#63. He who is a thorough teacher takes things seriously--and even
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.3#himself--only in relation to his pupils.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.4#64. "Knowledge for its own sake"--that is the last snare laid by
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.5#morality: we are thereby completely entangled in morals once more.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.6#65. The charm of knowledge would be small, were it not so much shame has
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.7#to be overcome on the way to it.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.8#65A. We are most dishonourable towards our God: he is not PERMITTED to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.9#sin.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.10#66. The tendency of a person to allow himself to be degraded, robbed,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.11#deceived, and exploited might be the diffidence of a God among men.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.12#67. Love to one only is a barbarity, for it is exercised at the expense
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.13#of all others. Love to God also!
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.14#68. "I did that," says my memory. "I could not have done that," says my
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.15#pride, and remains inexorable. Eventually--the memory yields.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.16#69. One has regarded life carelessly, if one has failed to see the hand
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.17#that--kills with leniency.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.18#70. If a man has character, he has also his typical experience, which
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.19#always recurs.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.20#71. THE SAGE AS ASTRONOMER.--So long as thou feelest the stars as an
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.21#"above thee," thou lackest the eye of the discerning one.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.22#72. It is not the strength, but the duration of great sentiments that
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.23#makes great men.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.24#73. He who attains his ideal, precisely thereby surpasses it.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.25#73A. Many a peacock hides his tail from every eye--and calls it his
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.26#pride.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.27#74. A man of genius is unbearable, unless he possess at least two things
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.28#besides: gratitude and purity.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.29#75. The degree and nature of a man's sensuality extends to the highest
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.30#altitudes of his spirit.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.31#76. Under peaceful conditions the militant man attacks himself.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.32#77. With his principles a man seeks either to dominate, or justify,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.33#or honour, or reproach, or conceal his habits: two men with the same
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.34#principles probably seek fundamentally different ends therewith.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.35#78. He who despises himself, nevertheless esteems himself thereby, as a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.36#despiser.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.37#79. A soul which knows that it is loved, but does not itself love,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.38#betrays its sediment: its dregs come up.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.39#80. A thing that is explained ceases to concern us--What did the God
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.40#mean who gave the advice, "Know thyself!" Did it perhaps imply "Cease to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.41#be concerned about thyself! become objective!"--And Socrates?--And the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.42#"scientific man"?
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.43#81. It is terrible to die of thirst at sea. Is it necessary that you
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.44#should so salt your truth that it will no longer--quench thirst?
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.45#82. "Sympathy for all"--would be harshness and tyranny for THEE, my good
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.46#neighbour.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.47#83. INSTINCT--When the house is on fire one forgets even the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.48#dinner--Yes, but one recovers it from among the ashes.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.49#84. Woman learns how to hate in proportion as she--forgets how to charm.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.50#85. The same emotions are in man and woman, but in different TEMPO, on
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.51#that account man and woman never cease to misunderstand each other.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.52#86. In the background of all their personal vanity, women themselves
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.53#have still their impersonal scorn--for "woman".
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.54#87. FETTERED HEART, FREE SPIRIT--When one firmly fetters one's heart
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.55#and keeps it prisoner, one can allow one's spirit many liberties: I said
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.56#this once before But people do not believe it when I say so, unless they
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.57#know it already.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.58#88. One begins to distrust very clever persons when they become
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.59#embarrassed.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.60#89. Dreadful experiences raise the question whether he who experiences
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.61#them is not something dreadful also.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.62#90. Heavy, melancholy men turn lighter, and come temporarily to their
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.63#surface, precisely by that which makes others heavy--by hatred and love.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.64#91. So cold, so icy, that one burns one's finger at the touch of him!
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.65#Every hand that lays hold of him shrinks back!--And for that very reason
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.66#many think him red-hot.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.67#92. Who has not, at one time or another--sacrificed himself for the sake
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.68#of his good name?
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.69#93. In affability there is no hatred of men, but precisely on that
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.70#account a great deal too much contempt of men.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.71#94. The maturity of man--that means, to have reacquired the seriousness
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.72#that one had as a child at play.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.73#95. To be ashamed of one's immorality is a step on the ladder at the end
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.74#of which one is ashamed also of one's morality.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.75#96. One should part from life as Ulysses parted from Nausicaa--blessing
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.76#it rather than in love with it.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.77#97. What? A great man? I always see merely the play-actor of his own
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.78#ideal.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.79#98. When one trains one's conscience, it kisses one while it bites.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.80#99. THE DISAPPOINTED ONE SPEAKS--"I listened for the echo and I heard
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.81#only praise."
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.82#100. We all feign to ourselves that we are simpler than we are, we thus
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.83#relax ourselves away from our fellows.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.84#101. A discerning one might easily regard himself at present as the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.85#animalization of God.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.86#102. Discovering reciprocal love should really disenchant the lover with
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.87#regard to the beloved. "What! She is modest enough to love even you? Or
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.88#stupid enough? Or--or---"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.89#103. THE DANGER IN HAPPINESS.--"Everything now turns out best for me, I
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.90#now love every fate:--who would like to be my fate?"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.91#104. Not their love of humanity, but the impotence of their love,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.92#prevents the Christians of today--burning us.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.93#105. The pia fraus is still more repugnant to the taste (the "piety")
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.94#of the free spirit (the "pious man of knowledge") than the impia fraus.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.95#Hence the profound lack of judgment, in comparison with the Church,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.96#characteristic of the type "free spirit"--as ITS non-freedom.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.97#106. By means of music the very passions enjoy themselves.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.98#107. A sign of strong character, when once the resolution has been
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.99#taken, to shut the ear even to the best counter-arguments. Occasionally,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.100#therefore, a will to stupidity.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.101#108. There is no such thing as moral phenomena, but only a moral
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.102#interpretation of phenomena.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.103#109. The criminal is often enough not equal to his deed: he extenuates
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.104#and maligns it.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.105#110. The advocates of a criminal are seldom artists enough to turn the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.106#beautiful terribleness of the deed to the advantage of the doer.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.107#111. Our vanity is most difficult to wound just when our pride has been
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.108#wounded.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.109#112. To him who feels himself preordained to contemplation and not to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.110#belief, all believers are too noisy and obtrusive; he guards against
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.111#them.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.112#113. "You want to prepossess him in your favour? Then you must be
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.113#embarrassed before him."
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.114#114. The immense expectation with regard to sexual love, and the coyness
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.115#in this expectation, spoils all the perspectives of women at the outset.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.116#115. Where there is neither love nor hatred in the game, woman's play is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.117#mediocre.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.118#116. The great epochs of our life are at the points when we gain courage
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.119#to rebaptize our badness as the best in us.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.120#117. The will to overcome an emotion, is ultimately only the will of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.121#another, or of several other, emotions.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.122#118. There is an innocence of admiration: it is possessed by him to whom
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.123#it has not yet occurred that he himself may be admired some day.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.124#119. Our loathing of dirt may be so great as to prevent our cleaning
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.125#ourselves--"justifying" ourselves.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.126#120. Sensuality often forces the growth of love too much, so that its
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.127#root remains weak, and is easily torn up.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.128#121. It is a curious thing that God learned Greek when he wished to turn
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.129#author--and that he did not learn it better.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.130#122. To rejoice on account of praise is in many cases merely politeness
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.131#of heart--and the very opposite of vanity of spirit.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.132#123. Even concubinage has been corrupted--by marriage.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.133#124. He who exults at the stake, does not triumph over pain, but because
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.134#of the fact that he does not feel pain where he expected it. A parable.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.135#125. When we have to change an opinion about any one, we charge heavily
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.136#to his account the inconvenience he thereby causes us.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.137#126. A nation is a detour of nature to arrive at six or seven great
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.138#men.--Yes, and then to get round them.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.139#127. In the eyes of all true women science is hostile to the sense of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.140#shame. They feel as if one wished to peep under their skin with it--or
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.141#worse still! under their dress and finery.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.142#128. The more abstract the truth you wish to teach, the more must you
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.143#allure the senses to it.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.144#129. The devil has the most extensive perspectives for God; on that
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.145#account he keeps so far away from him:--the devil, in effect, as the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.146#oldest friend of knowledge.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.147#130. What a person IS begins to betray itself when his talent
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.148#decreases,--when he ceases to show what he CAN do. Talent is also an
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.149#adornment; an adornment is also a concealment.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.150#131. The sexes deceive themselves about each other: the reason is that
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.151#in reality they honour and love only themselves (or their own ideal, to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.152#express it more agreeably). Thus man wishes woman to be peaceable: but
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.153#in fact woman is ESSENTIALLY unpeaceable, like the cat, however well she
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.154#may have assumed the peaceable demeanour.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.155#132. One is punished best for one's virtues.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.156#133. He who cannot find the way to HIS ideal, lives more frivolously and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.157#shamelessly than the man without an ideal.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.158#134. From the senses originate all trustworthiness, all good conscience,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.159#all evidence of truth.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.160#135. Pharisaism is not a deterioration of the good man; a considerable
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.161#part of it is rather an essential condition of being good.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.162#136. The one seeks an accoucheur for his thoughts, the other seeks some

urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.165#of opposite kinds: in a remarkable scholar one not infrequently finds

urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.180#something wrong with her sexual nature. Barrenness itself conduces to a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.181#certain virility of taste; man, indeed, if I may say so, is "the barren

urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.183#145. Comparing man and woman generally, one may say that woman would

urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:4.233#169. To talk much about oneself may also be a means of concealing

urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.1#CHAPTER V. THE NATURAL HISTORY OF MORALS
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.2#186. The moral sentiment in Europe at present is perhaps as subtle,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.3#belated, diverse, sensitive, and refined, as the "Science of Morals"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.4#belonging thereto is recent, initial, awkward, and coarse-fingered:--an
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.5#interesting contrast, which sometimes becomes incarnate and obvious
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.6#in the very person of a moralist. Indeed, the expression, "Science
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.7#of Morals" is, in respect to what is designated thereby, far too
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.8#presumptuous and counter to GOOD taste,--which is always a foretaste of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.9#more modest expressions. One ought to avow with the utmost fairness WHAT
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.10#is still necessary here for a long time, WHAT is alone proper for the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.11#present: namely, the collection of material, the comprehensive survey
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.12#and classification of an immense domain of delicate sentiments of worth,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.13#and distinctions of worth, which live, grow, propagate, and perish--and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.14#perhaps attempts to give a clear idea of the recurring and more common
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.15#forms of these living crystallizations--as preparation for a THEORY OF
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.16#TYPES of morality. To be sure, people have not hitherto been so modest.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.17#All the philosophers, with a pedantic and ridiculous seriousness,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.18#demanded of themselves something very much higher, more pretentious, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.19#ceremonious, when they concerned themselves with morality as a science:
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.20#they wanted to GIVE A BASIC to morality--and every philosopher hitherto
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.21#has believed that he has given it a basis; morality itself, however, has
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.22#been regarded as something "given." How far from their awkward pride
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.23#was the seemingly insignificant problem--left in dust and decay--of a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.24#description of forms of morality, notwithstanding that the finest hands
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.25#and senses could hardly be fine enough for it! It was precisely owing to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.26#moral philosophers' knowing the moral facts imperfectly, in an arbitrary
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.27#epitome, or an accidental abridgement--perhaps as the morality of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.28#their environment, their position, their church, their Zeitgeist, their
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.29#climate and zone--it was precisely because they were badly instructed
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.30#with regard to nations, eras, and past ages, and were by no means eager
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.31#to know about these matters, that they did not even come in sight of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.32#real problems of morals--problems which only disclose themselves by
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.33#a comparison of MANY kinds of morality. In every "Science of Morals"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.34#hitherto, strange as it may sound, the problem of morality itself
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.35#has been OMITTED: there has been no suspicion that there was anything
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.36#problematic there! That which philosophers called "giving a basis to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.37#morality," and endeavoured to realize, has, when seen in a right light,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.38#proved merely a learned form of good FAITH in prevailing morality, a new
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.39#means of its EXPRESSION, consequently just a matter-of-fact within the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.40#sphere of a definite morality, yea, in its ultimate motive, a sort of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.41#denial that it is LAWFUL for this morality to be called in question--and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.42#in any case the reverse of the testing, analyzing, doubting, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.43#vivisecting of this very faith. Hear, for instance, with what
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.44#innocence--almost worthy of honour--Schopenhauer represents his own
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.45#task, and draw your conclusions concerning the scientificness of a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.46#"Science" whose latest master still talks in the strain of children and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.47#old wives: "The principle," he says (page 136 of the Grundprobleme der
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.48#Ethik), [Footnote: Pages 54-55 of Schopenhauer's Basis of Morality,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.49#translated by Arthur B. Bullock, M.A. (1903).] "the axiom about the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.50#purport of which all moralists are PRACTICALLY agreed: neminem laede,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.51#immo omnes quantum potes juva--is REALLY the proposition which all moral
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.52#teachers strive to establish, ... the REAL basis of ethics which
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.53#has been sought, like the philosopher's stone, for centuries."--The
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.54#difficulty of establishing the proposition referred to may indeed be
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.55#great--it is well known that Schopenhauer also was unsuccessful in his
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.56#efforts; and whoever has thoroughly realized how absurdly false and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.57#sentimental this proposition is, in a world whose essence is Will
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.58#to Power, may be reminded that Schopenhauer, although a pessimist,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.59#ACTUALLY--played the flute... daily after dinner: one may read about
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.60#the matter in his biography. A question by the way: a pessimist, a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.61#repudiator of God and of the world, who MAKES A HALT at morality--who
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.62#assents to morality, and plays the flute to laede-neminem morals, what?
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.63#Is that really--a pessimist?
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.64#187. Apart from the value of such assertions as "there is a categorical
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.65#imperative in us," one can always ask: What does such an assertion
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.66#indicate about him who makes it? There are systems of morals which are
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.67#meant to justify their author in the eyes of other people; other systems
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.68#of morals are meant to tranquilize him, and make him self-satisfied;
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.69#with other systems he wants to crucify and humble himself, with others
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.70#he wishes to take revenge, with others to conceal himself, with others
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.71#to glorify himself and gave superiority and distinction,--this system of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.72#morals helps its author to forget, that system makes him, or something
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.73#of him, forgotten, many a moralist would like to exercise power and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.74#creative arbitrariness over mankind, many another, perhaps, Kant
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.75#especially, gives us to understand by his morals that "what is estimable
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.76#in me, is that I know how to obey--and with you it SHALL not be
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.77#otherwise than with me!" In short, systems of morals are only a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.78#SIGN-LANGUAGE OF THE EMOTIONS.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.79#188. In contrast to laisser-aller, every system of morals is a sort of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.80#tyranny against "nature" and also against "reason", that is, however, no
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.81#objection, unless one should again decree by some system of morals, that
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.82#all kinds of tyranny and unreasonableness are unlawful What is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.83#essential and invaluable in every system of morals, is that it is a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.84#long constraint. In order to understand Stoicism, or Port Royal,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.85#or Puritanism, one should remember the constraint under which every
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.86#language has attained to strength and freedom--the metrical constraint,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.87#the tyranny of rhyme and rhythm. How much trouble have the poets and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.88#orators of every nation given themselves!--not excepting some of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.89#the prose writers of today, in whose ear dwells an inexorable
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.90#conscientiousness--"for the sake of a folly," as utilitarian bunglers
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.91#say, and thereby deem themselves wise--"from submission to arbitrary
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.92#laws," as the anarchists say, and thereby fancy themselves "free," even
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.93#free-spirited. The singular fact remains, however, that everything
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.94#of the nature of freedom, elegance, boldness, dance, and masterly
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.95#certainty, which exists or has existed, whether it be in thought itself,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.96#or in administration, or in speaking and persuading, in art just as in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.97#conduct, has only developed by means of the tyranny of such arbitrary
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.98#law, and in all seriousness, it is not at all improbable that precisely
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.99#this is "nature" and "natural"--and not laisser-aller! Every artist
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.100#knows how different from the state of letting himself go, is his
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.101#"most natural" condition, the free arranging, locating, disposing,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.102#and constructing in the moments of "inspiration"--and how strictly and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.103#delicately he then obeys a thousand laws, which, by their very rigidness
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.104#and precision, defy all formulation by means of ideas (even the most
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.105#stable idea has, in comparison therewith, something floating, manifold,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.106#and ambiguous in it). The essential thing "in heaven and in earth" is,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.107#apparently (to repeat it once more), that there should be long OBEDIENCE
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.108#in the same direction, there thereby results, and has always resulted in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.109#the long run, something which has made life worth living; for instance,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.110#virtue, art, music, dancing, reason, spirituality--anything whatever
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.111#that is transfiguring, refined, foolish, or divine. The long bondage of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.112#the spirit, the distrustful constraint in the communicability of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.113#ideas, the discipline which the thinker imposed on himself to think
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.114#in accordance with the rules of a church or a court, or conformable
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.115#to Aristotelian premises, the persistent spiritual will to interpret
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.116#everything that happened according to a Christian scheme, and in every
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.117#occurrence to rediscover and justify the Christian God:--all this
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.118#violence, arbitrariness, severity, dreadfulness, and unreasonableness,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.119#has proved itself the disciplinary means whereby the European spirit has
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.120#attained its strength, its remorseless curiosity and subtle mobility;
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.121#granted also that much irrecoverable strength and spirit had to be
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.122#stifled, suffocated, and spoilt in the process (for here, as everywhere,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.123#"nature" shows herself as she is, in all her extravagant and INDIFFERENT
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.124#magnificence, which is shocking, but nevertheless noble). That
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.125#for centuries European thinkers only thought in order to prove
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.126#something--nowadays, on the contrary, we are suspicious of every thinker
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.127#who "wishes to prove something"--that it was always settled beforehand
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.128#what WAS TO BE the result of their strictest thinking, as it was perhaps
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.129#in the Asiatic astrology of former times, or as it is still at the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.130#present day in the innocent, Christian-moral explanation of immediate
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.131#personal events "for the glory of God," or "for the good of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.132#soul":--this tyranny, this arbitrariness, this severe and magnificent
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.133#stupidity, has EDUCATED the spirit; slavery, both in the coarser and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.134#the finer sense, is apparently an indispensable means even of spiritual
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.135#education and discipline. One may look at every system of morals in this
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.136#light: it is "nature" therein which teaches to hate the laisser-aller,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.137#the too great freedom, and implants the need for limited horizons, for
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.138#immediate duties--it teaches the NARROWING OF PERSPECTIVES, and thus, in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.139#a certain sense, that stupidity is a condition of life and development.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.140#"Thou must obey some one, and for a long time; OTHERWISE thou wilt come
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.141#to grief, and lose all respect for thyself"--this seems to me to be the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.142#moral imperative of nature, which is certainly neither "categorical,"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.143#as old Kant wished (consequently the "otherwise"), nor does it address
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.144#itself to the individual (what does nature care for the individual!),
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.145#but to nations, races, ages, and ranks; above all, however, to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.146#animal "man" generally, to MANKIND.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.147#189. Industrious races find it a great hardship to be idle: it was a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.148#master stroke of ENGLISH instinct to hallow and begloom Sunday to such
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.149#an extent that the Englishman unconsciously hankers for his week--and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.150#work-day again:--as a kind of cleverly devised, cleverly intercalated
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.151#FAST, such as is also frequently found in the ancient world (although,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.152#as is appropriate in southern nations, not precisely with respect
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.153#to work). Many kinds of fasts are necessary; and wherever powerful
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.154#influences and habits prevail, legislators have to see that intercalary
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.155#days are appointed, on which such impulses are fettered, and learn to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.156#hunger anew. Viewed from a higher standpoint, whole generations and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.157#epochs, when they show themselves infected with any moral fanaticism,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.158#seem like those intercalated periods of restraint and fasting, during
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.159#which an impulse learns to humble and submit itself--at the same time
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.160#also to PURIFY and SHARPEN itself; certain philosophical sects likewise
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.161#admit of a similar interpretation (for instance, the Stoa, in the midst
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.162#of Hellenic culture, with the atmosphere rank and overcharged with
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.163#Aphrodisiacal odours).--Here also is a hint for the explanation of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.164#paradox, why it was precisely in the most Christian period of European
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.165#history, and in general only under the pressure of Christian sentiments,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.166#that the sexual impulse sublimated into love (amour-passion).
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.167#190. There is something in the morality of Plato which does not really
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.168#belong to Plato, but which only appears in his philosophy, one might
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.169#say, in spite of him: namely, Socratism, for which he himself was
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.170#too noble. "No one desires to injure himself, hence all evil is done
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.171#unwittingly. The evil man inflicts injury on himself; he would not do
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.172#so, however, if he knew that evil is evil. The evil man, therefore, is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.173#only evil through error; if one free him from error one will necessarily
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.174#make him--good."--This mode of reasoning savours of the POPULACE, who
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.175#perceive only the unpleasant consequences of evil-doing, and practically
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.176#judge that "it is STUPID to do wrong"; while they accept "good" as
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.177#identical with "useful and pleasant," without further thought. As
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.178#regards every system of utilitarianism, one may at once assume that it
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.179#has the same origin, and follow the scent: one will seldom err.--Plato
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.180#did all he could to interpret something refined and noble into the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.181#tenets of his teacher, and above all to interpret himself into them--he,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.182#the most daring of all interpreters, who lifted the entire Socrates out
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.183#of the street, as a popular theme and song, to exhibit him in endless
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.184#and impossible modifications--namely, in all his own disguises and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.185#multiplicities. In jest, and in Homeric language as well, what is the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.186#Platonic Socrates, if not--[Greek words inserted here.]
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.187#191. The old theological problem of "Faith" and "Knowledge," or more
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.188#plainly, of instinct and reason--the question whether, in respect to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.189#valuation of things, instinct deserves more authority than rationality,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.190#which wants to appreciate and act according to motives, according to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.191#a "Why," that is to say, in conformity to purpose and utility--it
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.192#is always the old moral problem that first appeared in the person of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.193#Socrates, and had divided men's minds long before Christianity. Socrates
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.194#himself, following, of course, the taste of his talent--that of a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.195#surpassing dialectician--took first the side of reason; and, in fact,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.196#what did he do all his life but laugh at the awkward incapacity of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.197#noble Athenians, who were men of instinct, like all noble men, and could
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.198#never give satisfactory answers concerning the motives of their actions?
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.199#In the end, however, though silently and secretly, he laughed also
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.200#at himself: with his finer conscience and introspection, he found
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.201#in himself the same difficulty and incapacity. "But why"--he said
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.202#to himself--"should one on that account separate oneself from the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.203#instincts! One must set them right, and the reason ALSO--one must follow
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.204#the instincts, but at the same time persuade the reason to support them
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.205#with good arguments." This was the real FALSENESS of that great and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.206#mysterious ironist; he brought his conscience up to the point that he
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.207#was satisfied with a kind of self-outwitting: in fact, he perceived
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.208#the irrationality in the moral judgment.--Plato, more innocent in such
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.209#matters, and without the craftiness of the plebeian, wished to prove to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.210#himself, at the expenditure of all his strength--the greatest strength
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.211#a philosopher had ever expended--that reason and instinct lead
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.212#spontaneously to one goal, to the good, to "God"; and since Plato, all
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.213#theologians and philosophers have followed the same path--which means
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.214#that in matters of morality, instinct (or as Christians call it,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.215#"Faith," or as I call it, "the herd") has hitherto triumphed. Unless
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.216#one should make an exception in the case of Descartes, the father of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.217#rationalism (and consequently the grandfather of the Revolution), who
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.218#recognized only the authority of reason: but reason is only a tool, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.219#Descartes was superficial.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.220#192. Whoever has followed the history of a single science, finds in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.221#its development a clue to the understanding of the oldest and commonest
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.222#processes of all "knowledge and cognizance": there, as here, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.223#premature hypotheses, the fictions, the good stupid will to "belief,"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.224#and the lack of distrust and patience are first developed--our senses
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.225#learn late, and never learn completely, to be subtle, reliable, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.226#cautious organs of knowledge. Our eyes find it easier on a given
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.227#occasion to produce a picture already often produced, than to seize upon
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.228#the divergence and novelty of an impression: the latter requires more
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.229#force, more "morality." It is difficult and painful for the ear to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.230#listen to anything new; we hear strange music badly. When we hear
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.231#another language spoken, we involuntarily attempt to form the sounds
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.232#into words with which we are more familiar and conversant--it was thus,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.233#for example, that the Germans modified the spoken word ARCUBALISTA into
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.234#ARMBRUST (cross-bow). Our senses are also hostile and averse to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.235#new; and generally, even in the "simplest" processes of sensation, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.236#emotions DOMINATE--such as fear, love, hatred, and the passive emotion
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.237#of indolence.--As little as a reader nowadays reads all the single words
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.238#(not to speak of syllables) of a page--he rather takes about five out
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.239#of every twenty words at random, and "guesses" the probably appropriate
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.240#sense to them--just as little do we see a tree correctly and completely
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.241#in respect to its leaves, branches, colour, and shape; we find it so
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.242#much easier to fancy the chance of a tree. Even in the midst of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.243#most remarkable experiences, we still do just the same; we fabricate the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.244#greater part of the experience, and can hardly be made to contemplate
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.245#any event, EXCEPT as "inventors" thereof. All this goes to prove
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.246#that from our fundamental nature and from remote ages we have
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.247#been--ACCUSTOMED TO LYING. Or, to express it more politely and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.248#hypocritically, in short, more pleasantly--one is much more of an artist
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.249#than one is aware of.--In an animated conversation, I often see the face
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.250#of the person with whom I am speaking so clearly and sharply defined
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.251#before me, according to the thought he expresses, or which I believe to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.252#be evoked in his mind, that the degree of distinctness far exceeds the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.253#STRENGTH of my visual faculty--the delicacy of the play of the muscles
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.254#and of the expression of the eyes MUST therefore be imagined by me.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.255#Probably the person put on quite a different expression, or none at all.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.256#193. Quidquid luce fuit, tenebris agit: but also contrariwise. What we
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.257#experience in dreams, provided we experience it often, pertains at
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.258#last just as much to the general belongings of our soul as anything
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.259#"actually" experienced; by virtue thereof we are richer or poorer, we
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.260#have a requirement more or less, and finally, in broad daylight, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.261#even in the brightest moments of our waking life, we are ruled to some
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.262#extent by the nature of our dreams. Supposing that someone has often
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.263#flown in his dreams, and that at last, as soon as he dreams, he is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.264#conscious of the power and art of flying as his privilege and his
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.265#peculiarly enviable happiness; such a person, who believes that on the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.266#slightest impulse, he can actualize all sorts of curves and angles, who
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.267#knows the sensation of a certain divine levity, an "upwards"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.268#without effort or constraint, a "downwards" without descending
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.269#or lowering--without TROUBLE!--how could the man with such
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.270#dream-experiences and dream-habits fail to find "happiness" differently
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.271#coloured and defined, even in his waking hours! How could he fail--to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.272#long DIFFERENTLY for happiness? "Flight," such as is described by poets,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.273#must, when compared with his own "flying," be far too earthly, muscular,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.274#violent, far too "troublesome" for him.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.275#194. The difference among men does not manifest itself only in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.276#difference of their lists of desirable things--in their regarding
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.277#different good things as worth striving for, and being disagreed as to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.278#the greater or less value, the order of rank, of the commonly recognized
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.279#desirable things:--it manifests itself much more in what they regard as
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.280#actually HAVING and POSSESSING a desirable thing. As regards a woman,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.281#for instance, the control over her body and her sexual gratification
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.282#serves as an amply sufficient sign of ownership and possession to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.283#more modest man; another with a more suspicious and ambitious thirst for
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.284#possession, sees the "questionableness," the mere apparentness of such
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.285#ownership, and wishes to have finer tests in order to know especially
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.286#whether the woman not only gives herself to him, but also gives up for
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.287#his sake what she has or would like to have--only THEN does he look upon
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.288#her as "possessed." A third, however, has not even here got to the limit
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.289#of his distrust and his desire for possession: he asks himself whether
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.290#the woman, when she gives up everything for him, does not perhaps do
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.291#so for a phantom of him; he wishes first to be thoroughly, indeed,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.292#profoundly well known; in order to be loved at all he ventures to let
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.293#himself be found out. Only then does he feel the beloved one fully in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.294#his possession, when she no longer deceives herself about him, when
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.295#she loves him just as much for the sake of his devilry and concealed
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.296#insatiability, as for his goodness, patience, and spirituality. One
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.297#man would like to possess a nation, and he finds all the higher arts of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.298#Cagliostro and Catalina suitable for his purpose. Another, with a more
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.299#refined thirst for possession, says to himself: "One may not deceive
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.300#where one desires to possess"--he is irritated and impatient at the idea
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.301#that a mask of him should rule in the hearts of the people: "I must,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.302#therefore, MAKE myself known, and first of all learn to know myself!"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.303#Among helpful and charitable people, one almost always finds the awkward
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.304#craftiness which first gets up suitably him who has to be helped, as
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.305#though, for instance, he should "merit" help, seek just THEIR help, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.306#would show himself deeply grateful, attached, and subservient to them
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.307#for all help. With these conceits, they take control of the needy as a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.308#property, just as in general they are charitable and helpful out of a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.309#desire for property. One finds them jealous when they are crossed or
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.310#forestalled in their charity. Parents involuntarily make something like
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.311#themselves out of their children--they call that "education"; no mother
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.312#doubts at the bottom of her heart that the child she has borne is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.313#thereby her property, no father hesitates about his right to HIS OWN
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.314#ideas and notions of worth. Indeed, in former times fathers deemed it
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.315#right to use their discretion concerning the life or death of the newly
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.316#born (as among the ancient Germans). And like the father, so also do the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.317#teacher, the class, the priest, and the prince still see in every new
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.318#individual an unobjectionable opportunity for a new possession. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.319#consequence is...
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.320#195. The Jews--a people "born for slavery," as Tacitus and the whole
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.321#ancient world say of them; "the chosen people among the nations," as
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.322#they themselves say and believe--the Jews performed the miracle of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.323#inversion of valuations, by means of which life on earth obtained a new
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.324#and dangerous charm for a couple of millenniums. Their prophets fused

urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.327#reproach. In this inversion of valuations (in which is also included
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.328#the use of the word "poor" as synonymous with "saint" and "friend") the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.329#significance of the Jewish people is to be found; it is with THEM that
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.330#the SLAVE-INSURRECTION IN MORALS commences.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.331#196. It is to be INFERRED that there are countless dark bodies near the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.332#sun--such as we shall never see. Among ourselves, this is an allegory;
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.333#and the psychologist of morals reads the whole star-writing merely as an
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.334#allegorical and symbolic language in which much may be unexpressed.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.335#197. The beast of prey and the man of prey (for instance, Caesar Borgia)
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.336#are fundamentally misunderstood, "nature" is misunderstood, so long as
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.337#one seeks a "morbidness" in the constitution of these healthiest of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.338#all tropical monsters and growths, or even an innate "hell" in them--as
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.339#almost all moralists have done hitherto. Does it not seem that there is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.340#a hatred of the virgin forest and of the tropics among moralists? And
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.341#that the "tropical man" must be discredited at all costs, whether
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.342#as disease and deterioration of mankind, or as his own hell and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.343#self-torture? And why? In favour of the "temperate zones"? In favour
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.344#of the temperate men? The "moral"? The mediocre?--This for the chapter:
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.345#"Morals as Timidity."
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.346#198. All the systems of morals which address themselves with a view to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.347#their "happiness," as it is called--what else are they but suggestions
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.348#for behaviour adapted to the degree of DANGER from themselves in which
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.349#the individuals live; recipes for their passions, their good and bad
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.350#propensities, insofar as such have the Will to Power and would like
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.351#to play the master; small and great expediencies and elaborations,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.352#permeated with the musty odour of old family medicines and old-wife
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.353#wisdom; all of them grotesque and absurd in their form--because
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.354#they address themselves to "all," because they generalize where
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.355#generalization is not authorized; all of them speaking unconditionally,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.356#and taking themselves unconditionally; all of them flavoured not merely
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.357#with one grain of salt, but rather endurable only, and sometimes even
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.358#seductive, when they are over-spiced and begin to smell dangerously,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.359#especially of "the other world." That is all of little value when
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.360#estimated intellectually, and is far from being "science," much less
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.361#"wisdom"; but, repeated once more, and three times repeated, it is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.362#expediency, expediency, expediency, mixed with stupidity, stupidity,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.363#stupidity--whether it be the indifference and statuesque coldness
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.364#towards the heated folly of the emotions, which the Stoics advised and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.365#fostered; or the no-more-laughing and no-more-weeping of Spinoza, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.366#destruction of the emotions by their analysis and vivisection, which he
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.367#recommended so naively; or the lowering of the emotions to an innocent
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.368#mean at which they may be satisfied, the Aristotelianism of morals;
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.369#or even morality as the enjoyment of the emotions in a voluntary
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.370#attenuation and spiritualization by the symbolism of art, perhaps as
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.371#music, or as love of God, and of mankind for God's sake--for in religion
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.372#the passions are once more enfranchised, provided that...; or, finally,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.373#even the complaisant and wanton surrender to the emotions, as has
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.374#been taught by Hafis and Goethe, the bold letting-go of the reins, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.375#spiritual and corporeal licentia morum in the exceptional cases of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.376#wise old codgers and drunkards, with whom it "no longer has much
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.377#danger."--This also for the chapter: "Morals as Timidity."
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.378#199. Inasmuch as in all ages, as long as mankind has existed, there have
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.379#also been human herds (family alliances, communities, tribes, peoples,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.380#states, churches), and always a great number who obey in proportion
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.381#to the small number who command--in view, therefore, of the fact that
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.382#obedience has been most practiced and fostered among mankind hitherto,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.383#one may reasonably suppose that, generally speaking, the need thereof is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.384#now innate in every one, as a kind of FORMAL CONSCIENCE which gives
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.385#the command "Thou shalt unconditionally do something, unconditionally
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.386#refrain from something", in short, "Thou shalt". This need tries to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.387#satisfy itself and to fill its form with a content, according to its
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.388#strength, impatience, and eagerness, it at once seizes as an omnivorous
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.389#appetite with little selection, and accepts whatever is shouted into
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.390#its ear by all sorts of commanders--parents, teachers, laws, class
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.391#prejudices, or public opinion. The extraordinary limitation of human
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.392#development, the hesitation, protractedness, frequent retrogression, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.393#turning thereof, is attributable to the fact that the herd-instinct of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.394#obedience is transmitted best, and at the cost of the art of command. If
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.395#one imagine this instinct increasing to its greatest extent, commanders
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.396#and independent individuals will finally be lacking altogether, or they
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.397#will suffer inwardly from a bad conscience, and will have to impose
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.398#a deception on themselves in the first place in order to be able to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.399#command just as if they also were only obeying. This condition of things
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.400#actually exists in Europe at present--I call it the moral hypocrisy of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.401#the commanding class. They know no other way of protecting themselves
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.402#from their bad conscience than by playing the role of executors of older
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.403#and higher orders (of predecessors, of the constitution, of justice, of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.404#the law, or of God himself), or they even justify themselves by maxims
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.405#from the current opinions of the herd, as "first servants of their
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.406#people," or "instruments of the public weal". On the other hand, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.407#gregarious European man nowadays assumes an air as if he were the only
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.408#kind of man that is allowable, he glorifies his qualities, such as
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.409#public spirit, kindness, deference, industry, temperance, modesty,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.410#indulgence, sympathy, by virtue of which he is gentle, endurable, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.411#useful to the herd, as the peculiarly human virtues. In cases, however,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.412#where it is believed that the leader and bell-wether cannot be dispensed
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.413#with, attempt after attempt is made nowadays to replace commanders
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.414#by the summing together of clever gregarious men all representative
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.415#constitutions, for example, are of this origin. In spite of all, what a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.416#blessing, what a deliverance from a weight becoming unendurable, is the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.417#appearance of an absolute ruler for these gregarious Europeans--of this
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.418#fact the effect of the appearance of Napoleon was the last great proof
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.419#the history of the influence of Napoleon is almost the history of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.420#the higher happiness to which the entire century has attained in its
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.421#worthiest individuals and periods.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.422#200. The man of an age of dissolution which mixes the races with
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.423#one another, who has the inheritance of a diversified descent in his
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.424#body--that is to say, contrary, and often not only contrary, instincts
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.425#and standards of value, which struggle with one another and are seldom
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.426#at peace--such a man of late culture and broken lights, will, on an
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.427#average, be a weak man. His fundamental desire is that the war which is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.428#IN HIM should come to an end; happiness appears to him in the character
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.429#of a soothing medicine and mode of thought (for instance, Epicurean
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.430#or Christian); it is above all things the happiness of repose, of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.431#undisturbedness, of repletion, of final unity--it is the "Sabbath of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.432#Sabbaths," to use the expression of the holy rhetorician, St. Augustine,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.433#who was himself such a man.--Should, however, the contrariety and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.434#conflict in such natures operate as an ADDITIONAL incentive and stimulus
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.435#to life--and if, on the other hand, in addition to their powerful and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.436#irreconcilable instincts, they have also inherited and indoctrinated
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.437#into them a proper mastery and subtlety for carrying on the conflict
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.438#with themselves (that is to say, the faculty of self-control and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.439#self-deception), there then arise those marvelously incomprehensible and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.440#inexplicable beings, those enigmatical men, predestined for conquering
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.441#and circumventing others, the finest examples of which are Alcibiades
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.442#and Caesar (with whom I should like to associate the FIRST of Europeans
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.443#according to my taste, the Hohenstaufen, Frederick the Second), and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.444#among artists, perhaps Leonardo da Vinci. They appear precisely in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.445#same periods when that weaker type, with its longing for repose, comes
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.446#to the front; the two types are complementary to each other, and spring
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.447#from the same causes.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.448#201. As long as the utility which determines moral estimates is only
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.449#gregarious utility, as long as the preservation of the community is only
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.450#kept in view, and the immoral is sought precisely and exclusively in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.451#what seems dangerous to the maintenance of the community, there can be
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.452#no "morality of love to one's neighbour." Granted even that there is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.453#already a little constant exercise of consideration, sympathy, fairness,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.454#gentleness, and mutual assistance, granted that even in this condition
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.455#of society all those instincts are already active which are latterly
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.456#distinguished by honourable names as "virtues," and eventually almost
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.457#coincide with the conception "morality": in that period they do not
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.458#as yet belong to the domain of moral valuations--they are still
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.459#ULTRA-MORAL. A sympathetic action, for instance, is neither called good
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.460#nor bad, moral nor immoral, in the best period of the Romans; and should
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.461#it be praised, a sort of resentful disdain is compatible with this
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.462#praise, even at the best, directly the sympathetic action is compared
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.463#with one which contributes to the welfare of the whole, to the RES
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.464#PUBLICA. After all, "love to our neighbour" is always a secondary
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.465#matter, partly conventional and arbitrarily manifested in relation to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.466#our FEAR OF OUR NEIGHBOUR. After the fabric of society seems on the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.467#whole established and secured against external dangers, it is this
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.468#fear of our neighbour which again creates new perspectives of moral
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.469#valuation. Certain strong and dangerous instincts, such as the love of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.470#enterprise, foolhardiness, revengefulness, astuteness, rapacity, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.471#love of power, which up till then had not only to be honoured from the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.472#point of view of general utility--under other names, of course, than
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.473#those here given--but had to be fostered and cultivated (because they
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.474#were perpetually required in the common danger against the common
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.475#enemies), are now felt in their dangerousness to be doubly strong--when
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.476#the outlets for them are lacking--and are gradually branded as immoral
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.477#and given over to calumny. The contrary instincts and inclinations now
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.478#attain to moral honour, the gregarious instinct gradually draws its
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.479#conclusions. How much or how little dangerousness to the community or
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.480#to equality is contained in an opinion, a condition, an emotion, a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.481#disposition, or an endowment--that is now the moral perspective, here
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.482#again fear is the mother of morals. It is by the loftiest and strongest
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.483#instincts, when they break out passionately and carry the individual
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.484#far above and beyond the average, and the low level of the gregarious
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.485#conscience, that the self-reliance of the community is destroyed, its
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.486#belief in itself, its backbone, as it were, breaks, consequently these
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.487#very instincts will be most branded and defamed. The lofty independent
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.488#spirituality, the will to stand alone, and even the cogent reason, are
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.489#felt to be dangers, everything that elevates the individual above the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.490#herd, and is a source of fear to the neighbour, is henceforth called
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.491#EVIL, the tolerant, unassuming, self-adapting, self-equalizing
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.492#disposition, the MEDIOCRITY of desires, attains to moral distinction and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.493#honour. Finally, under very peaceful circumstances, there is always
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.494#less opportunity and necessity for training the feelings to severity
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.495#and rigour, and now every form of severity, even in justice, begins
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.496#to disturb the conscience, a lofty and rigorous nobleness and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.497#self-responsibility almost offends, and awakens distrust, "the lamb,"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.498#and still more "the sheep," wins respect. There is a point of diseased
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.499#mellowness and effeminacy in the history of society, at which society
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.500#itself takes the part of him who injures it, the part of the CRIMINAL,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.501#and does so, in fact, seriously and honestly. To punish, appears to it
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.502#to be somehow unfair--it is certain that the idea of "punishment" and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.503#"the obligation to punish" are then painful and alarming to people. "Is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.504#it not sufficient if the criminal be rendered HARMLESS? Why should we
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.505#still punish? Punishment itself is terrible!"--with these questions
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.506#gregarious morality, the morality of fear, draws its ultimate
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.507#conclusion. If one could at all do away with danger, the cause of fear,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.508#one would have done away with this morality at the same time, it
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.509#would no longer be necessary, it WOULD NOT CONSIDER ITSELF any longer
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.510#necessary!--Whoever examines the conscience of the present-day European,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.511#will always elicit the same imperative from its thousand moral folds
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.512#and hidden recesses, the imperative of the timidity of the herd "we wish
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.513#that some time or other there may be NOTHING MORE TO FEAR!" Some time
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.514#or other--the will and the way THERETO is nowadays called "progress" all
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.515#over Europe.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.516#202. Let us at once say again what we have already said a hundred
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.517#times, for people's ears nowadays are unwilling to hear such truths--OUR
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.518#truths. We know well enough how offensive it sounds when any one
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.519#plainly, and without metaphor, counts man among the animals, but it will
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.520#be accounted to us almost a CRIME, that it is precisely in respect to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.521#men of "modern ideas" that we have constantly applied the terms "herd,"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.522#"herd-instincts," and such like expressions. What avail is it? We cannot
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.523#do otherwise, for it is precisely here that our new insight is. We
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.524#have found that in all the principal moral judgments, Europe has become
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.525#unanimous, including likewise the countries where European influence
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.526#prevails in Europe people evidently KNOW what Socrates thought he
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.527#did not know, and what the famous serpent of old once promised to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.528#teach--they "know" today what is good and evil. It must then sound hard
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.529#and be distasteful to the ear, when we always insist that that which
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.530#here thinks it knows, that which here glorifies itself with praise
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.531#and blame, and calls itself good, is the instinct of the herding human
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.532#animal, the instinct which has come and is ever coming more and more
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.533#to the front, to preponderance and supremacy over other instincts,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.534#according to the increasing physiological approximation and resemblance
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.535#of which it is the symptom. MORALITY IN EUROPE AT PRESENT IS
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.536#HERDING-ANIMAL MORALITY, and therefore, as we understand the matter,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.537#only one kind of human morality, beside which, before which, and after
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.538#which many other moralities, and above all HIGHER moralities, are or
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.539#should be possible. Against such a "possibility," against such a "should
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.540#be," however, this morality defends itself with all its strength, it
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.541#says obstinately and inexorably "I am morality itself and nothing else
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.542#is morality!" Indeed, with the help of a religion which has humoured
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.543#and flattered the sublimest desires of the herding-animal, things have
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.544#reached such a point that we always find a more visible expression of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.545#this morality even in political and social arrangements: the DEMOCRATIC
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.546#movement is the inheritance of the Christian movement. That its TEMPO,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.547#however, is much too slow and sleepy for the more impatient ones, for
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.548#those who are sick and distracted by the herding-instinct, is indicated
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.549#by the increasingly furious howling, and always less disguised
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.550#teeth-gnashing of the anarchist dogs, who are now roving through the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.551#highways of European culture. Apparently in opposition to the peacefully
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.552#industrious democrats and Revolution-ideologues, and still more so
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.553#to the awkward philosophasters and fraternity-visionaries who call
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.554#themselves Socialists and want a "free society," those are really at one
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.555#with them all in their thorough and instinctive hostility to every form
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.556#of society other than that of the AUTONOMOUS herd (to the extent even of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.557#repudiating the notions "master" and "servant"--ni dieu ni maitre, says
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.558#a socialist formula); at one in their tenacious opposition to every
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.559#special claim, every special right and privilege (this means ultimately
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.560#opposition to EVERY right, for when all are equal, no one needs "rights"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.561#any longer); at one in their distrust of punitive justice (as though it
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.562#were a violation of the weak, unfair to the NECESSARY consequences of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.563#all former society); but equally at one in their religion of sympathy,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.564#in their compassion for all that feels, lives, and suffers (down to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.565#very animals, up even to "God"--the extravagance of "sympathy for
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.566#God" belongs to a democratic age); altogether at one in the cry and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.567#impatience of their sympathy, in their deadly hatred of suffering
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.568#generally, in their almost feminine incapacity for witnessing it or
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.569#ALLOWING it; at one in their involuntary beglooming and heart-softening,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.570#under the spell of which Europe seems to be threatened with a new
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.571#Buddhism; at one in their belief in the morality of MUTUAL sympathy, as
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.572#though it were morality in itself, the climax, the ATTAINED climax of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.573#mankind, the sole hope of the future, the consolation of the present,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.574#the great discharge from all the obligations of the past; altogether at
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.575#one in their belief in the community as the DELIVERER, in the herd, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.576#therefore in "themselves."
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.577#203. We, who hold a different belief--we, who regard the democratic
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.578#movement, not only as a degenerating form of political organization, but
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.579#as equivalent to a degenerating, a waning type of man, as involving his
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.580#mediocrising and depreciation: where have WE to fix our hopes? In
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.581#NEW PHILOSOPHERS--there is no other alternative: in minds strong and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.582#original enough to initiate opposite estimates of value, to transvalue
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.583#and invert "eternal valuations"; in forerunners, in men of the future,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.584#who in the present shall fix the constraints and fasten the knots which
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.585#will compel millenniums to take NEW paths. To teach man the future
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.586#of humanity as his WILL, as depending on human will, and to make
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.587#preparation for vast hazardous enterprises and collective attempts in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.588#rearing and educating, in order thereby to put an end to the frightful
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.589#rule of folly and chance which has hitherto gone by the name of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.590#"history" (the folly of the "greatest number" is only its last
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.591#form)--for that purpose a new type of philosopher and commander will
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.592#some time or other be needed, at the very idea of which everything that
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.593#has existed in the way of occult, terrible, and benevolent beings might
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.594#look pale and dwarfed. The image of such leaders hovers before OUR
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.595#eyes:--is it lawful for me to say it aloud, ye free spirits? The
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.596#conditions which one would partly have to create and partly utilize for
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.597#their genesis; the presumptive methods and tests by virtue of which
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.598#a soul should grow up to such an elevation and power as to feel a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.599#CONSTRAINT to these tasks; a transvaluation of values, under the new
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.600#pressure and hammer of which a conscience should be steeled and a heart
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.601#transformed into brass, so as to bear the weight of such responsibility;
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.602#and on the other hand the necessity for such leaders, the dreadful
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.603#danger that they might be lacking, or miscarry and degenerate:--these
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.604#are OUR real anxieties and glooms, ye know it well, ye free spirits!
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.605#these are the heavy distant thoughts and storms which sweep across the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.606#heaven of OUR life. There are few pains so grievous as to have seen,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.607#divined, or experienced how an exceptional man has missed his way and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.608#deteriorated; but he who has the rare eye for the universal danger
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.609#of "man" himself DETERIORATING, he who like us has recognized the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.610#extraordinary fortuitousness which has hitherto played its game in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.611#respect to the future of mankind--a game in which neither the hand, nor
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.612#even a "finger of God" has participated!--he who divines the fate that
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.613#is hidden under the idiotic unwariness and blind confidence of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.614#"modern ideas," and still more under the whole of Christo-European
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.615#morality--suffers from an anguish with which no other is to be compared.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.616#He sees at a glance all that could still BE MADE OUT OF MAN through
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.617#a favourable accumulation and augmentation of human powers and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.618#arrangements; he knows with all the knowledge of his conviction how
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.619#unexhausted man still is for the greatest possibilities, and how often
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.620#in the past the type man has stood in presence of mysterious decisions
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.621#and new paths:--he knows still better from his painfulest recollections
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.622#on what wretched obstacles promising developments of the highest rank
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.623#have hitherto usually gone to pieces, broken down, sunk, and become
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.624#contemptible. The UNIVERSAL DEGENERACY OF MANKIND to the level of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.625#the "man of the future"--as idealized by the socialistic fools and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.626#shallow-pates--this degeneracy and dwarfing of man to an absolutely
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.627#gregarious animal (or as they call it, to a man of "free society"),
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.628#this brutalizing of man into a pigmy with equal rights and claims, is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.629#undoubtedly POSSIBLE! He who has thought out this possibility to its
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.630#ultimate conclusion knows ANOTHER loathing unknown to the rest of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:5.631#mankind--and perhaps also a new MISSION!
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.1#CHAPTER VI. WE SCHOLARS
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.2#204. At the risk that moralizing may also reveal itself here as that
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.3#which it has always been--namely, resolutely MONTRER SES PLAIES,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.4#according to Balzac--I would venture to protest against an improper and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.5#injurious alteration of rank, which quite unnoticed, and as if with the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.6#best conscience, threatens nowadays to establish itself in the relations
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.7#of science and philosophy. I mean to say that one must have the right
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.8#out of one's own EXPERIENCE--experience, as it seems to me, always
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.9#implies unfortunate experience?--to treat of such an important question
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.10#of rank, so as not to speak of colour like the blind, or AGAINST science
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.11#like women and artists ("Ah! this dreadful science!" sigh their instinct
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.12#and their shame, "it always FINDS THINGS OUT!"). The declaration of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.13#independence of the scientific man, his emancipation from philosophy,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.14#is one of the subtler after-effects of democratic organization and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.15#disorganization: the self-glorification and self-conceitedness of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.16#the learned man is now everywhere in full bloom, and in its best
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.17#springtime--which does not mean to imply that in this case self-praise
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.18#smells sweet. Here also the instinct of the populace cries, "Freedom
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.19#from all masters!" and after science has, with the happiest results,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.20#resisted theology, whose "hand-maid" it had been too long, it now
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.21#proposes in its wantonness and indiscretion to lay down laws for
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.22#philosophy, and in its turn to play the "master"--what am I saying!
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.23#to play the PHILOSOPHER on its own account. My memory--the memory of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.24#a scientific man, if you please!--teems with the naivetes of insolence
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.25#which I have heard about philosophy and philosophers from young
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.26#naturalists and old physicians (not to mention the most cultured and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.27#most conceited of all learned men, the philologists and schoolmasters,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.28#who are both the one and the other by profession). On one occasion it
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.29#was the specialist and the Jack Horner who instinctively stood on the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.30#defensive against all synthetic tasks and capabilities; at another time
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.31#it was the industrious worker who had got a scent of OTIUM and refined
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.32#luxuriousness in the internal economy of the philosopher, and felt
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.33#himself aggrieved and belittled thereby. On another occasion it was the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.34#colour-blindness of the utilitarian, who sees nothing in philosophy but
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.35#a series of REFUTED systems, and an extravagant expenditure which "does
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.36#nobody any good". At another time the fear of disguised mysticism and of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.37#the boundary-adjustment of knowledge became conspicuous, at another
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.38#time the disregard of individual philosophers, which had involuntarily
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.39#extended to disregard of philosophy generally. In fine, I found most
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.40#frequently, behind the proud disdain of philosophy in young scholars,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.41#the evil after-effect of some particular philosopher, to whom on the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.42#whole obedience had been foresworn, without, however, the spell of his
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.43#scornful estimates of other philosophers having been got rid of--the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.44#result being a general ill-will to all philosophy. (Such seems to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.45#me, for instance, the after-effect of Schopenhauer on the most modern
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.46#Germany: by his unintelligent rage against Hegel, he has succeeded in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.47#severing the whole of the last generation of Germans from its connection
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.48#with German culture, which culture, all things considered, has been
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.49#an elevation and a divining refinement of the HISTORICAL SENSE, but
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.50#precisely at this point Schopenhauer himself was poor, irreceptive,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.51#and un-German to the extent of ingeniousness.) On the whole, speaking
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.52#generally, it may just have been the humanness, all-too-humanness of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.53#modern philosophers themselves, in short, their contemptibleness, which
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.54#has injured most radically the reverence for philosophy and opened the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.55#doors to the instinct of the populace. Let it but be acknowledged to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.56#what an extent our modern world diverges from the whole style of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.57#world of Heraclitus, Plato, Empedocles, and whatever else all the royal
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.58#and magnificent anchorites of the spirit were called, and with what
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.59#justice an honest man of science MAY feel himself of a better family and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.60#origin, in view of such representatives of philosophy, who, owing to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.61#the fashion of the present day, are just as much aloft as they are down
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.62#below--in Germany, for instance, the two lions of Berlin, the anarchist
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.63#Eugen Duhring and the amalgamist Eduard von Hartmann. It is especially
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.64#the sight of those hotch-potch philosophers, who call themselves
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.65#"realists," or "positivists," which is calculated to implant a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.66#dangerous distrust in the soul of a young and ambitious scholar those
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.67#philosophers, at the best, are themselves but scholars and specialists,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.68#that is very evident! All of them are persons who have been vanquished
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.69#and BROUGHT BACK AGAIN under the dominion of science, who at one time
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.70#or another claimed more from themselves, without having a right to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.71#"more" and its responsibility--and who now, creditably, rancorously, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.72#vindictively, represent in word and deed, DISBELIEF in the master-task
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.73#and supremacy of philosophy After all, how could it be otherwise?
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.74#Science flourishes nowadays and has the good conscience clearly visible
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.75#on its countenance, while that to which the entire modern philosophy has
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.76#gradually sunk, the remnant of philosophy of the present day, excites
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.77#distrust and displeasure, if not scorn and pity Philosophy reduced to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.78#a "theory of knowledge," no more in fact than a diffident science of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.79#epochs and doctrine of forbearance a philosophy that never even
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.80#gets beyond the threshold, and rigorously DENIES itself the right
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.81#to enter--that is philosophy in its last throes, an end, an agony,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.82#something that awakens pity. How could such a philosophy--RULE!
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.83#205. The dangers that beset the evolution of the philosopher are, in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.84#fact, so manifold nowadays, that one might doubt whether this fruit
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.85#could still come to maturity. The extent and towering structure of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.86#sciences have increased enormously, and therewith also the probability
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.87#that the philosopher will grow tired even as a learner, or will attach
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.88#himself somewhere and "specialize" so that he will no longer attain to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.89#his elevation, that is to say, to his superspection, his circumspection,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.90#and his DESPECTION. Or he gets aloft too late, when the best of his
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.91#maturity and strength is past, or when he is impaired, coarsened, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.92#deteriorated, so that his view, his general estimate of things, is no
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.93#longer of much importance. It is perhaps just the refinement of his
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.94#intellectual conscience that makes him hesitate and linger on the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.95#way, he dreads the temptation to become a dilettante, a millepede, a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.96#milleantenna, he knows too well that as a discerner, one who has lost
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.97#his self-respect no longer commands, no longer LEADS, unless he should
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.98#aspire to become a great play-actor, a philosophical Cagliostro and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.99#spiritual rat-catcher--in short, a misleader. This is in the last
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.100#instance a question of taste, if it has not really been a question of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.101#conscience. To double once more the philosopher's difficulties, there is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.102#also the fact that he demands from himself a verdict, a Yea or Nay, not
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.103#concerning science, but concerning life and the worth of life--he learns
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.104#unwillingly to believe that it is his right and even his duty to obtain
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.105#this verdict, and he has to seek his way to the right and the belief
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.106#only through the most extensive (perhaps disturbing and destroying)
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.107#experiences, often hesitating, doubting, and dumbfounded. In fact, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.108#philosopher has long been mistaken and confused by the multitude, either
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.109#with the scientific man and ideal scholar, or with the religiously
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.110#elevated, desensualized, desecularized visionary and God-intoxicated
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.111#man; and even yet when one hears anybody praised, because he lives
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.112#"wisely," or "as a philosopher," it hardly means anything more than
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.113#"prudently and apart." Wisdom: that seems to the populace to be a kind
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.114#of flight, a means and artifice for withdrawing successfully from a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.115#bad game; but the GENUINE philosopher--does it not seem so to US,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.116#my friends?--lives "unphilosophically" and "unwisely," above all,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.117#IMPRUDENTLY, and feels the obligation and burden of a hundred attempts
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.118#and temptations of life--he risks HIMSELF constantly, he plays THIS bad
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.119#game.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.120#206. In relation to the genius, that is to say, a being who either
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.121#ENGENDERS or PRODUCES--both words understood in their fullest sense--the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.122#man of learning, the scientific average man, has always something of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.123#the old maid about him; for, like her, he is not conversant with the two
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.124#principal functions of man. To both, of course, to the scholar and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.125#to the old maid, one concedes respectability, as if by way of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.126#indemnification--in these cases one emphasizes the respectability--and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.127#yet, in the compulsion of this concession, one has the same admixture
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.128#of vexation. Let us examine more closely: what is the scientific man?
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.129#Firstly, a commonplace type of man, with commonplace virtues: that is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.130#to say, a non-ruling, non-authoritative, and non-self-sufficient type
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.131#of man; he possesses industry, patient adaptableness to rank and file,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.132#equability and moderation in capacity and requirement; he has the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.133#instinct for people like himself, and for that which they require--for
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.134#instance: the portion of independence and green meadow without which
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.135#there is no rest from labour, the claim to honour and consideration
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.136#(which first and foremost presupposes recognition and recognisability),
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.137#the sunshine of a good name, the perpetual ratification of his value and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.138#usefulness, with which the inward DISTRUST which lies at the bottom of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.139#the heart of all dependent men and gregarious animals, has again and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.140#again to be overcome. The learned man, as is appropriate, has also
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.141#maladies and faults of an ignoble kind: he is full of petty envy, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.142#has a lynx-eye for the weak points in those natures to whose elevations
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.143#he cannot attain. He is confiding, yet only as one who lets himself go,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.144#but does not FLOW; and precisely before the man of the great current he
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.145#stands all the colder and more reserved--his eye is then like a smooth
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.146#and irresponsive lake, which is no longer moved by rapture or sympathy.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.147#The worst and most dangerous thing of which a scholar is capable results
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.148#from the instinct of mediocrity of his type, from the Jesuitism of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.149#mediocrity, which labours instinctively for the destruction of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.150#the exceptional man, and endeavours to break--or still better, to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.151#relax--every bent bow To relax, of course, with consideration, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.152#naturally with an indulgent hand--to RELAX with confiding sympathy
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.153#that is the real art of Jesuitism, which has always understood how to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.154#introduce itself as the religion of sympathy.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.155#207. However gratefully one may welcome the OBJECTIVE spirit--and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.156#who has not been sick to death of all subjectivity and its confounded
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.157#IPSISIMOSITY!--in the end, however, one must learn caution even with
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.158#regard to one's gratitude, and put a stop to the exaggeration with
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.159#which the unselfing and depersonalizing of the spirit has recently been
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.160#celebrated, as if it were the goal in itself, as if it were salvation
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.161#and glorification--as is especially accustomed to happen in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.162#pessimist school, which has also in its turn good reasons for paying the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.163#highest honours to "disinterested knowledge" The objective man, who no
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.164#longer curses and scolds like the pessimist, the IDEAL man of learning
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.165#in whom the scientific instinct blossoms forth fully after a thousand
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.166#complete and partial failures, is assuredly one of the most costly
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.167#instruments that exist, but his place is in the hand of one who is more
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.168#powerful He is only an instrument, we may say, he is a MIRROR--he is no
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.169#"purpose in himself" The objective man is in truth a mirror accustomed
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.170#to prostration before everything that wants to be known, with such
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.171#desires only as knowing or "reflecting" implies--he waits until
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.172#something comes, and then expands himself sensitively, so that even the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.173#light footsteps and gliding-past of spiritual beings may not be lost on
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.174#his surface and film Whatever "personality" he still possesses seems to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.175#him accidental, arbitrary, or still oftener, disturbing, so much has he
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.176#come to regard himself as the passage and reflection of outside forms
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.177#and events He calls up the recollection of "himself" with an effort,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.178#and not infrequently wrongly, he readily confounds himself with other
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.179#persons, he makes mistakes with regard to his own needs, and here only
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.180#is he unrefined and negligent Perhaps he is troubled about the health,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.181#or the pettiness and confined atmosphere of wife and friend, or the lack
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.182#of companions and society--indeed, he sets himself to reflect on his
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.183#suffering, but in vain! His thoughts already rove away to the MORE
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.184#GENERAL case, and tomorrow he knows as little as he knew yesterday how
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.185#to help himself He does not now take himself seriously and devote time
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.186#to himself he is serene, NOT from lack of trouble, but from lack
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.187#of capacity for grasping and dealing with HIS trouble The habitual
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.188#complaisance with respect to all objects and experiences, the radiant
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.189#and impartial hospitality with which he receives everything that
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.190#comes his way, his habit of inconsiderate good-nature, of dangerous
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.191#indifference as to Yea and Nay: alas! there are enough of cases in which
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.192#he has to atone for these virtues of his!--and as man generally, he
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.193#becomes far too easily the CAPUT MORTUUM of such virtues. Should one
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.194#wish love or hatred from him--I mean love and hatred as God, woman, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.195#animal understand them--he will do what he can, and furnish what he can.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.196#But one must not be surprised if it should not be much--if he should
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.197#show himself just at this point to be false, fragile, questionable, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.198#deteriorated. His love is constrained, his hatred is artificial, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.199#rather UN TOUR DE FORCE, a slight ostentation and exaggeration. He is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.200#only genuine so far as he can be objective; only in his serene totality
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.201#is he still "nature" and "natural." His mirroring and eternally
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.202#self-polishing soul no longer knows how to affirm, no longer how to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.203#deny; he does not command; neither does he destroy. "JE NE MEPRISE
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.204#PRESQUE RIEN"--he says, with Leibniz: let us not overlook nor undervalue
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.205#the PRESQUE! Neither is he a model man; he does not go in advance of any
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.206#one, nor after, either; he places himself generally too far off to have
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.207#any reason for espousing the cause of either good or evil. If he has
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.208#been so long confounded with the PHILOSOPHER, with the Caesarian trainer
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.209#and dictator of civilization, he has had far too much honour, and what
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.210#is more essential in him has been overlooked--he is an instrument,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.211#something of a slave, though certainly the sublimest sort of slave, but
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.212#nothing in himself--PRESQUE RIEN! The objective man is an instrument,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.213#a costly, easily injured, easily tarnished measuring instrument and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.214#mirroring apparatus, which is to be taken care of and respected; but he
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.215#is no goal, not outgoing nor upgoing, no complementary man in whom the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.216#REST of existence justifies itself, no termination--and still less a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.217#commencement, an engendering, or primary cause, nothing hardy, powerful,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.218#self-centred, that wants to be master; but rather only a soft, inflated,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.219#delicate, movable potter's-form, that must wait for some kind of content
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.220#and frame to "shape" itself thereto--for the most part a man without
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.221#frame and content, a "selfless" man. Consequently, also, nothing for
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.222#women, IN PARENTHESI.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.223#208. When a philosopher nowadays makes known that he is not a skeptic--I
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.224#hope that has been gathered from the foregoing description of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.225#objective spirit?--people all hear it impatiently; they regard him on
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.226#that account with some apprehension, they would like to ask so many,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.227#many questions... indeed among timid hearers, of whom there are now so
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.228#many, he is henceforth said to be dangerous. With his repudiation of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.229#skepticism, it seems to them as if they heard some evil-threatening
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.230#sound in the distance, as if a new kind of explosive were being tried
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.231#somewhere, a dynamite of the spirit, perhaps a newly discovered Russian
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.232#NIHILINE, a pessimism BONAE VOLUNTATIS, that not only denies, means
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.233#denial, but--dreadful thought! PRACTISES denial. Against this kind of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.234#"good-will"--a will to the veritable, actual negation of life--there is,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.235#as is generally acknowledged nowadays, no better soporific and sedative
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.236#than skepticism, the mild, pleasing, lulling poppy of skepticism;
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.237#and Hamlet himself is now prescribed by the doctors of the day as an
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.238#antidote to the "spirit," and its underground noises. "Are not our ears
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.239#already full of bad sounds?" say the skeptics, as lovers of repose, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.240#almost as a kind of safety police; "this subterranean Nay is terrible!
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.241#Be still, ye pessimistic moles!" The skeptic, in effect, that delicate
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.242#creature, is far too easily frightened; his conscience is schooled so
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.243#as to start at every Nay, and even at that sharp, decided Yea, and feels
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.244#something like a bite thereby. Yea! and Nay!--they seem to him opposed
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.245#to morality; he loves, on the contrary, to make a festival to his virtue
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.246#by a noble aloofness, while perhaps he says with Montaigne: "What do I
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.247#know?" Or with Socrates: "I know that I know nothing." Or: "Here I do
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.248#not trust myself, no door is open to me." Or: "Even if the door were
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.249#open, why should I enter immediately?" Or: "What is the use of any hasty
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.250#hypotheses? It might quite well be in good taste to make no hypotheses
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.251#at all. Are you absolutely obliged to straighten at once what is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.252#crooked? to stuff every hole with some kind of oakum? Is there not time
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.253#enough for that? Has not the time leisure? Oh, ye demons, can ye not
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.254#at all WAIT? The uncertain also has its charms, the Sphinx, too, is a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.255#Circe, and Circe, too, was a philosopher."--Thus does a skeptic console
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.256#himself; and in truth he needs some consolation. For skepticism is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.257#the most spiritual expression of a certain many-sided physiological
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.258#temperament, which in ordinary language is called nervous debility and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.259#sickliness; it arises whenever races or classes which have been long
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.260#separated, decisively and suddenly blend with one another. In the new
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.261#generation, which has inherited as it were different standards and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.262#valuations in its blood, everything is disquiet, derangement, doubt, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.263#tentativeness; the best powers operate restrictively, the very virtues
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.264#prevent each other growing and becoming strong, equilibrium, ballast,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.265#and perpendicular stability are lacking in body and soul. That, however,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.266#which is most diseased and degenerated in such nondescripts is the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.267#WILL; they are no longer familiar with independence of decision, or
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.268#the courageous feeling of pleasure in willing--they are doubtful of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.269#"freedom of the will" even in their dreams Our present-day Europe,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.270#the scene of a senseless, precipitate attempt at a radical blending of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.271#classes, and CONSEQUENTLY of races, is therefore skeptical in all its
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.272#heights and depths, sometimes exhibiting the mobile skepticism which
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.273#springs impatiently and wantonly from branch to branch, sometimes with
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.274#gloomy aspect, like a cloud over-charged with interrogative signs--and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.275#often sick unto death of its will! Paralysis of will, where do we not
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.276#find this cripple sitting nowadays! And yet how bedecked oftentimes' How
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.277#seductively ornamented! There are the finest gala dresses and disguises
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.278#for this disease, and that, for instance, most of what places itself
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.279#nowadays in the show-cases as "objectiveness," "the scientific spirit,"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.280#"L'ART POUR L'ART," and "pure voluntary knowledge," is only decked-out
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.281#skepticism and paralysis of will--I am ready to answer for this
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.282#diagnosis of the European disease--The disease of the will is diffused
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.283#unequally over Europe, it is worst and most varied where civilization
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.284#has longest prevailed, it decreases according as "the barbarian"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.285#still--or again--asserts his claims under the loose drapery of Western
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.286#culture It is therefore in the France of today, as can be readily
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.287#disclosed and comprehended, that the will is most infirm, and France,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.288#which has always had a masterly aptitude for converting even the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.289#portentous crises of its spirit into something charming and seductive,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.290#now manifests emphatically its intellectual ascendancy over Europe,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.291#by being the school and exhibition of all the charms of skepticism The
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.292#power to will and to persist, moreover, in a resolution, is already
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.293#somewhat stronger in Germany, and again in the North of Germany it
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.294#is stronger than in Central Germany, it is considerably stronger in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.295#England, Spain, and Corsica, associated with phlegm in the former and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.296#with hard skulls in the latter--not to mention Italy, which is too young
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.297#yet to know what it wants, and must first show whether it can exercise
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.298#will, but it is strongest and most surprising of all in that immense
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.299#middle empire where Europe as it were flows back to Asia--namely, in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.300#Russia There the power to will has been long stored up and accumulated,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.301#there the will--uncertain whether to be negative or affirmative--waits
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.302#threateningly to be discharged (to borrow their pet phrase from our
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.303#physicists) Perhaps not only Indian wars and complications in Asia would
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.304#be necessary to free Europe from its greatest danger, but also internal
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.305#subversion, the shattering of the empire into small states, and above
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.306#all the introduction of parliamentary imbecility, together with the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.307#obligation of every one to read his newspaper at breakfast I do not
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.308#say this as one who desires it, in my heart I should rather prefer the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.309#contrary--I mean such an increase in the threatening attitude of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.310#Russia, that Europe would have to make up its mind to become equally
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.311#threatening--namely, TO ACQUIRE ONE WILL, by means of a new caste to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.312#rule over the Continent, a persistent, dreadful will of its own, that
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.313#can set its aims thousands of years ahead; so that the long spun-out
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.314#comedy of its petty-statism, and its dynastic as well as its democratic
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.315#many-willed-ness, might finally be brought to a close. The time for
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.316#petty politics is past; the next century will bring the struggle for the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.317#dominion of the world--the COMPULSION to great politics.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.318#209. As to how far the new warlike age on which we Europeans have
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.319#evidently entered may perhaps favour the growth of another and stronger
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.320#kind of skepticism, I should like to express myself preliminarily
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.321#merely by a parable, which the lovers of German history will already
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.322#understand. That unscrupulous enthusiast for big, handsome grenadiers
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.323#(who, as King of Prussia, brought into being a military and skeptical
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.324#genius--and therewith, in reality, the new and now triumphantly emerged
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.325#type of German), the problematic, crazy father of Frederick the Great,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.326#had on one point the very knack and lucky grasp of the genius: he knew
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.327#what was then lacking in Germany, the want of which was a hundred times
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.328#more alarming and serious than any lack of culture and social form--his
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.329#ill-will to the young Frederick resulted from the anxiety of a profound
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.330#instinct. MEN WERE LACKING; and he suspected, to his bitterest regret,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.331#that his own son was not man enough. There, however, he deceived
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.332#himself; but who would not have deceived himself in his place? He saw
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.333#his son lapsed to atheism, to the ESPRIT, to the pleasant frivolity of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.334#clever Frenchmen--he saw in the background the great bloodsucker, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.335#spider skepticism; he suspected the incurable wretchedness of a heart no
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.336#longer hard enough either for evil or good, and of a broken will that no
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.337#longer commands, is no longer ABLE to command. Meanwhile, however,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.338#there grew up in his son that new kind of harder and more dangerous
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.339#skepticism--who knows TO WHAT EXTENT it was encouraged just by
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.340#his father's hatred and the icy melancholy of a will condemned to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.341#solitude?--the skepticism of daring manliness, which is closely related
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.342#to the genius for war and conquest, and made its first entrance into
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.343#Germany in the person of the great Frederick. This skepticism despises
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.344#and nevertheless grasps; it undermines and takes possession; it does
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.345#not believe, but it does not thereby lose itself; it gives the spirit a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.346#dangerous liberty, but it keeps strict guard over the heart. It is the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.347#GERMAN form of skepticism, which, as a continued Fredericianism, risen
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.348#to the highest spirituality, has kept Europe for a considerable time
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.349#under the dominion of the German spirit and its critical and historical
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.350#distrust Owing to the insuperably strong and tough masculine character
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.351#of the great German philologists and historical critics (who,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.352#rightly estimated, were also all of them artists of destruction
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.353#and dissolution), a NEW conception of the German spirit gradually
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.354#established itself--in spite of all Romanticism in music and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.355#philosophy--in which the leaning towards masculine skepticism was
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.356#decidedly prominent whether, for instance, as fearlessness of gaze, as
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.357#courage and sternness of the dissecting hand, or as resolute will to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.358#dangerous voyages of discovery, to spiritualized North Pole expeditions
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.359#under barren and dangerous skies. There may be good grounds for it when
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.360#warm-blooded and superficial humanitarians cross themselves before this
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.361#spirit, CET ESPRIT FATALISTE, IRONIQUE, MEPHISTOPHELIQUE, as Michelet
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.362#calls it, not without a shudder. But if one would realize how
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.363#characteristic is this fear of the "man" in the German spirit which
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.364#awakened Europe out of its "dogmatic slumber," let us call to mind the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.365#former conception which had to be overcome by this new one--and that
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.366#it is not so very long ago that a masculinized woman could dare, with
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.367#unbridled presumption, to recommend the Germans to the interest of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.368#Europe as gentle, good-hearted, weak-willed, and poetical fools.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.369#Finally, let us only understand profoundly enough Napoleon's
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.370#astonishment when he saw Goethe it reveals what had been regarded for
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.371#centuries as the "German spirit" "VOILA UN HOMME!"--that was as much as
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.372#to say "But this is a MAN! And I only expected to see a German!"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.373#210. Supposing, then, that in the picture of the philosophers of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.374#future, some trait suggests the question whether they must not perhaps
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.375#be skeptics in the last-mentioned sense, something in them would only be
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.376#designated thereby--and not they themselves. With equal right they might
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.377#call themselves critics, and assuredly they will be men of experiments.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.378#By the name with which I ventured to baptize them, I have already
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.379#expressly emphasized their attempting and their love of attempting is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.380#this because, as critics in body and soul, they will love to make use
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.381#of experiments in a new, and perhaps wider and more dangerous sense? In
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.382#their passion for knowledge, will they have to go further in daring and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.383#painful attempts than the sensitive and pampered taste of a democratic
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.384#century can approve of?--There is no doubt these coming ones will be
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.385#least able to dispense with the serious and not unscrupulous qualities
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.386#which distinguish the critic from the skeptic I mean the certainty as to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.387#standards of worth, the conscious employment of a unity of method,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.388#the wary courage, the standing-alone, and the capacity for
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.389#self-responsibility, indeed, they will avow among themselves a DELIGHT
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.390#in denial and dissection, and a certain considerate cruelty, which knows
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.391#how to handle the knife surely and deftly, even when the heart bleeds
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.392#They will be STERNER (and perhaps not always towards themselves only)
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.393#than humane people may desire, they will not deal with the "truth" in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.394#order that it may "please" them, or "elevate" and "inspire" them--they
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.395#will rather have little faith in "TRUTH" bringing with it such revels
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.396#for the feelings. They will smile, those rigorous spirits, when any one
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.397#says in their presence "That thought elevates me, why should it not be
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.398#true?" or "That work enchants me, why should it not be beautiful?" or
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.399#"That artist enlarges me, why should he not be great?" Perhaps they
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.400#will not only have a smile, but a genuine disgust for all that is thus
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.401#rapturous, idealistic, feminine, and hermaphroditic, and if any one
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.402#could look into their inmost hearts, he would not easily find therein
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.403#the intention to reconcile "Christian sentiments" with "antique taste,"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.404#or even with "modern parliamentarism" (the kind of reconciliation
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.405#necessarily found even among philosophers in our very uncertain and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.406#consequently very conciliatory century). Critical discipline, and every
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.407#habit that conduces to purity and rigour in intellectual matters,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.408#will not only be demanded from themselves by these philosophers of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.409#the future, they may even make a display thereof as their special
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.410#adornment--nevertheless they will not want to be called critics on that
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.411#account. It will seem to them no small indignity to philosophy to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.412#have it decreed, as is so welcome nowadays, that "philosophy itself is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.413#criticism and critical science--and nothing else whatever!" Though this
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.414#estimate of philosophy may enjoy the approval of all the Positivists of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.415#France and Germany (and possibly it even flattered the heart and taste
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.416#of KANT: let us call to mind the titles of his principal works), our new
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.417#philosophers will say, notwithstanding, that critics are instruments of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.418#the philosopher, and just on that account, as instruments, they are
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.419#far from being philosophers themselves! Even the great Chinaman of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.420#Konigsberg was only a great critic.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.421#211. I insist upon it that people finally cease confounding
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.422#philosophical workers, and in general scientific men, with
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.423#philosophers--that precisely here one should strictly give "each his
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.424#own," and not give those far too much, these far too little. It may
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.425#be necessary for the education of the real philosopher that he himself
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.426#should have once stood upon all those steps upon which his servants,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.427#the scientific workers of philosophy, remain standing, and MUST remain
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.428#standing he himself must perhaps have been critic, and dogmatist,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.429#and historian, and besides, poet, and collector, and traveler, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.430#riddle-reader, and moralist, and seer, and "free spirit," and almost
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.431#everything, in order to traverse the whole range of human values
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.432#and estimations, and that he may BE ABLE with a variety of eyes and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.433#consciences to look from a height to any distance, from a depth up
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.434#to any height, from a nook into any expanse. But all these are only
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.435#preliminary conditions for his task; this task itself demands something
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.436#else--it requires him TO CREATE VALUES. The philosophical workers, after
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.437#the excellent pattern of Kant and Hegel, have to fix and formalize some
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.438#great existing body of valuations--that is to say, former DETERMINATIONS
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.439#OF VALUE, creations of value, which have become prevalent, and are for
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.440#a time called "truths"--whether in the domain of the LOGICAL, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.441#POLITICAL (moral), or the ARTISTIC. It is for these investigators to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.442#make whatever has happened and been esteemed hitherto, conspicuous,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.443#conceivable, intelligible, and manageable, to shorten everything long,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.444#even "time" itself, and to SUBJUGATE the entire past: an immense and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.445#wonderful task, in the carrying out of which all refined pride, all
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.446#tenacious will, can surely find satisfaction. THE REAL PHILOSOPHERS,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.447#HOWEVER, ARE COMMANDERS AND LAW-GIVERS; they say: "Thus SHALL it be!"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.448#They determine first the Whither and the Why of mankind, and thereby
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.449#set aside the previous labour of all philosophical workers, and all
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.450#subjugators of the past--they grasp at the future with a creative
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.451#hand, and whatever is and was, becomes for them thereby a means, an
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.452#instrument, and a hammer. Their "knowing" is CREATING, their creating
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.453#is a law-giving, their will to truth is--WILL TO POWER.--Are there at
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.454#present such philosophers? Have there ever been such philosophers? MUST
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.455#there not be such philosophers some day? ...
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.456#212. It is always more obvious to me that the philosopher, as a man
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.457#INDISPENSABLE for the morrow and the day after the morrow, has ever
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.458#found himself, and HAS BEEN OBLIGED to find himself, in contradiction
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.459#to the day in which he lives; his enemy has always been the ideal of his
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.460#day. Hitherto all those extraordinary furtherers of humanity whom one
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.461#calls philosophers--who rarely regarded themselves as lovers of wisdom,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.462#but rather as disagreeable fools and dangerous interrogators--have found
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.463#their mission, their hard, involuntary, imperative mission (in the end,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.464#however, the greatness of their mission), in being the bad conscience of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.465#their age. In putting the vivisector's knife to the breast of the very
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.466#VIRTUES OF THEIR AGE, they have betrayed their own secret; it has been
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.467#for the sake of a NEW greatness of man, a new untrodden path to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.468#his aggrandizement. They have always disclosed how much hypocrisy,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.469#indolence, self-indulgence, and self-neglect, how much falsehood was
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.470#concealed under the most venerated types of contemporary morality, how
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.471#much virtue was OUTLIVED, they have always said "We must remove hence to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.472#where YOU are least at home" In the face of a world of "modern ideas,"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.473#which would like to confine every one in a corner, in a "specialty," a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.474#philosopher, if there could be philosophers nowadays, would be compelled
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.475#to place the greatness of man, the conception of "greatness," precisely
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.476#in his comprehensiveness and multifariousness, in his all-roundness, he
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.477#would even determine worth and rank according to the amount and variety
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.478#of that which a man could bear and take upon himself, according to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.479#EXTENT to which a man could stretch his responsibility Nowadays the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.480#taste and virtue of the age weaken and attenuate the will, nothing is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.481#so adapted to the spirit of the age as weakness of will consequently, in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.482#the ideal of the philosopher, strength of will, sternness, and capacity
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.483#for prolonged resolution, must specially be included in the conception
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.484#of "greatness", with as good a right as the opposite doctrine, with its
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.485#ideal of a silly, renouncing, humble, selfless humanity, was suited to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.486#an opposite age--such as the sixteenth century, which suffered from its
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.487#accumulated energy of will, and from the wildest torrents and floods
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.488#of selfishness In the time of Socrates, among men only of worn-out
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.489#instincts, old conservative Athenians who let themselves go--"for the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.490#sake of happiness," as they said, for the sake of pleasure, as their
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.491#conduct indicated--and who had continually on their lips the old pompous
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.492#words to which they had long forfeited the right by the life they led,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.493#IRONY was perhaps necessary for greatness of soul, the wicked Socratic
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.494#assurance of the old physician and plebeian, who cut ruthlessly into his
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.495#own flesh, as into the flesh and heart of the "noble," with a look that
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.496#said plainly enough "Do not dissemble before me! here--we are equal!"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.497#At present, on the contrary, when throughout Europe the herding-animal
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.498#alone attains to honours, and dispenses honours, when "equality of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.499#right" can too readily be transformed into equality in wrong--I mean to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.500#say into general war against everything rare, strange, and privileged,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.501#against the higher man, the higher soul, the higher duty, the higher
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.502#responsibility, the creative plenipotence and lordliness--at present
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.503#it belongs to the conception of "greatness" to be noble, to wish to be
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.504#apart, to be capable of being different, to stand alone, to have to live
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.505#by personal initiative, and the philosopher will betray something of his
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.506#own ideal when he asserts "He shall be the greatest who can be the most
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.507#solitary, the most concealed, the most divergent, the man beyond good
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.508#and evil, the master of his virtues, and of super-abundance of will;
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.509#precisely this shall be called GREATNESS: as diversified as can be
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.510#entire, as ample as can be full." And to ask once more the question: Is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.511#greatness POSSIBLE--nowadays?
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.512#213. It is difficult to learn what a philosopher is, because it cannot
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.513#be taught: one must "know" it by experience--or one should have the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.514#pride NOT to know it. The fact that at present people all talk of things
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.515#of which they CANNOT have any experience, is true more especially
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.516#and unfortunately as concerns the philosopher and philosophical
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.517#matters:--the very few know them, are permitted to know them, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.518#all popular ideas about them are false. Thus, for instance, the truly
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.519#philosophical combination of a bold, exuberant spirituality which runs
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.520#at presto pace, and a dialectic rigour and necessity which makes no
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.521#false step, is unknown to most thinkers and scholars from their own
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.522#experience, and therefore, should any one speak of it in their
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.523#presence, it is incredible to them. They conceive of every necessity as
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.524#troublesome, as a painful compulsory obedience and state of constraint;
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.525#thinking itself is regarded by them as something slow and hesitating,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.526#almost as a trouble, and often enough as "worthy of the SWEAT of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.527#noble"--but not at all as something easy and divine, closely related
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.528#to dancing and exuberance! "To think" and to take a matter "seriously,"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.529#"arduously"--that is one and the same thing to them; such only has been
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.530#their "experience."--Artists have here perhaps a finer intuition; they
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.531#who know only too well that precisely when they no longer do anything
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.532#"arbitrarily," and everything of necessity, their feeling of freedom,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.533#of subtlety, of power, of creatively fixing, disposing, and shaping,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.534#reaches its climax--in short, that necessity and "freedom of will" are
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.535#then the same thing with them. There is, in fine, a gradation of rank
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.536#in psychical states, to which the gradation of rank in the problems
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.537#corresponds; and the highest problems repel ruthlessly every one who

urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.539#by the loftiness and power of his spirituality. Of what use is it for
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.540#nimble, everyday intellects, or clumsy, honest mechanics and empiricists
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.541#to press, in their plebeian ambition, close to such problems, and as
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.542#it were into this "holy of holies"--as so often happens nowadays! But
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.543#coarse feet must never tread upon such carpets: this is provided for in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.544#the primary law of things; the doors remain closed to those intruders,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.545#though they may dash and break their heads thereon. People have always
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.546#to be born to a high station, or, more definitely, they have to be BRED
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.547#for it: a person has only a right to philosophy--taking the word in

urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.549#"blood," decide here also. Many generations must have prepared the way
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.550#for the coming of the philosopher; each of his virtues must have been
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.551#separately acquired, nurtured, transmitted, and embodied; not only the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.552#bold, easy, delicate course and current of his thoughts, but above all
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.553#the readiness for great responsibilities, the majesty of ruling glance
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.554#and contemning look, the feeling of separation from the multitude with
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.555#their duties and virtues, the kindly patronage and defense of whatever
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.556#is misunderstood and calumniated, be it God or devil, the delight and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.557#practice of supreme justice, the art of commanding, the amplitude of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:6.558#will, the lingering eye which rarely admires, rarely looks up, rarely

urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.1#CHAPTER VII. OUR VIRTUES
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.2#214. OUR Virtues?--It is probable that we, too, have still our virtues,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.3#although naturally they are not those sincere and massive virtues on
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.4#account of which we hold our grandfathers in esteem and also at a little
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.5#distance from us. We Europeans of the day after tomorrow, we firstlings
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.6#of the twentieth century--with all our dangerous curiosity, our
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.7#multifariousness and art of disguising, our mellow and seemingly
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.8#sweetened cruelty in sense and spirit--we shall presumably, IF we must
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.9#have virtues, have those only which have come to agreement with our most
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.10#secret and heartfelt inclinations, with our most ardent requirements:
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.11#well, then, let us look for them in our labyrinths!--where, as we know,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.12#so many things lose themselves, so many things get quite lost! And is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.13#there anything finer than to SEARCH for one's own virtues? Is it not
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.14#almost to BELIEVE in one's own virtues? But this "believing in one's
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.15#own virtues"--is it not practically the same as what was formerly called
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.16#one's "good conscience," that long, respectable pigtail of an idea,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.17#which our grandfathers used to hang behind their heads, and often enough
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.18#also behind their understandings? It seems, therefore, that however
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.19#little we may imagine ourselves to be old-fashioned and grandfatherly
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.20#respectable in other respects, in one thing we are nevertheless the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.21#worthy grandchildren of our grandfathers, we last Europeans with good
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.22#consciences: we also still wear their pigtail.--Ah! if you only knew how
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.23#soon, so very soon--it will be different!
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.24#215. As in the stellar firmament there are sometimes two suns which
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.25#determine the path of one planet, and in certain cases suns of different
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.26#colours shine around a single planet, now with red light, now with
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.27#green, and then simultaneously illumine and flood it with motley
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.28#colours: so we modern men, owing to the complicated mechanism of our
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.29#"firmament," are determined by DIFFERENT moralities; our actions shine
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.30#alternately in different colours, and are seldom unequivocal--and there
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.31#are often cases, also, in which our actions are MOTLEY-COLOURED.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.32#216. To love one's enemies? I think that has been well learnt: it takes
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.33#place thousands of times at present on a large and small scale; indeed,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.34#at times the higher and sublimer thing takes place:--we learn to DESPISE
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.35#when we love, and precisely when we love best; all of it, however,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.36#unconsciously, without noise, without ostentation, with the shame and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.37#secrecy of goodness, which forbids the utterance of the pompous word
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.38#and the formula of virtue. Morality as attitude--is opposed to our taste
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.39#nowadays. This is ALSO an advance, as it was an advance in our fathers
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.40#that religion as an attitude finally became opposed to their taste,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.41#including the enmity and Voltairean bitterness against religion (and all
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.42#that formerly belonged to freethinker-pantomime). It is the music in our
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.43#conscience, the dance in our spirit, to which Puritan litanies, moral
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.44#sermons, and goody-goodness won't chime.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.45#217. Let us be careful in dealing with those who attach great importance
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.46#to being credited with moral tact and subtlety in moral discernment!
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.47#They never forgive us if they have once made a mistake BEFORE us
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.48#(or even with REGARD to us)--they inevitably become our instinctive
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.49#calumniators and detractors, even when they still remain our
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.50#"friends."--Blessed are the forgetful: for they "get the better" even of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.51#their blunders.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.52#218. The psychologists of France--and where else are there still
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.53#psychologists nowadays?--have never yet exhausted their bitter and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.54#manifold enjoyment of the betise bourgeoise, just as though... in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.55#short, they betray something thereby. Flaubert, for instance, the honest
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.56#citizen of Rouen, neither saw, heard, nor tasted anything else in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.57#end; it was his mode of self-torment and refined cruelty. As this is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.58#growing wearisome, I would now recommend for a change something else
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.59#for a pleasure--namely, the unconscious astuteness with which good, fat,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.60#honest mediocrity always behaves towards loftier spirits and the tasks
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.61#they have to perform, the subtle, barbed, Jesuitical astuteness, which
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.62#is a thousand times subtler than the taste and understanding of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.63#middle-class in its best moments--subtler even than the understanding of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.64#its victims:--a repeated proof that "instinct" is the most intelligent
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.65#of all kinds of intelligence which have hitherto been discovered. In
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.66#short, you psychologists, study the philosophy of the "rule" in its
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.67#struggle with the "exception": there you have a spectacle fit for Gods
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.68#and godlike malignity! Or, in plainer words, practise vivisection on
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.69#"good people," on the "homo bonae voluntatis," ON YOURSELVES!
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.70#219. The practice of judging and condemning morally, is the favourite
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.71#revenge of the intellectually shallow on those who are less so, it is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.72#also a kind of indemnity for their being badly endowed by nature,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.73#and finally, it is an opportunity for acquiring spirit and BECOMING
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.74#subtle--malice spiritualises. They are glad in their inmost heart that
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.75#there is a standard according to which those who are over-endowed with
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.76#intellectual goods and privileges, are equal to them, they contend for
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.77#the "equality of all before God," and almost NEED the belief in God for
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.78#this purpose. It is among them that the most powerful antagonists of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.79#atheism are found. If any one were to say to them "A lofty spirituality
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.80#is beyond all comparison with the honesty and respectability of a merely
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.81#moral man"--it would make them furious, I shall take care not to say
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.82#so. I would rather flatter them with my theory that lofty spirituality
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.83#itself exists only as the ultimate product of moral qualities, that it
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.84#is a synthesis of all qualities attributed to the "merely moral" man,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.85#after they have been acquired singly through long training and practice,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.86#perhaps during a whole series of generations, that lofty spirituality
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.87#is precisely the spiritualising of justice, and the beneficent severity
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.88#which knows that it is authorized to maintain GRADATIONS OF RANK in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.89#world, even among things--and not only among men.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.90#220. Now that the praise of the "disinterested person" is so popular
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.91#one must--probably not without some danger--get an idea of WHAT people
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.92#actually take an interest in, and what are the things generally which
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.93#fundamentally and profoundly concern ordinary men--including the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.94#cultured, even the learned, and perhaps philosophers also, if
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.95#appearances do not deceive. The fact thereby becomes obvious that the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.96#greater part of what interests and charms higher natures, and more
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.97#refined and fastidious tastes, seems absolutely "uninteresting" to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.98#the average man--if, notwithstanding, he perceive devotion to these
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.99#interests, he calls it desinteresse, and wonders how it is possible to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.100#act "disinterestedly." There have been philosophers who could give this
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.101#popular astonishment a seductive and mystical, other-worldly expression
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.102#(perhaps because they did not know the higher nature by experience?),
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.103#instead of stating the naked and candidly reasonable truth that
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.104#"disinterested" action is very interesting and "interested" action,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.105#provided that... "And love?"--What! Even an action for love's sake
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.106#shall be "unegoistic"? But you fools--! "And the praise of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.107#self-sacrificer?"--But whoever has really offered sacrifice knows that
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.108#he wanted and obtained something for it--perhaps something from himself
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.109#for something from himself; that he relinquished here in order to have
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.110#more there, perhaps in general to be more, or even feel himself "more."
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.111#But this is a realm of questions and answers in which a more fastidious
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.112#spirit does not like to stay: for here truth has to stifle her yawns so
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.113#much when she is obliged to answer. And after all, truth is a woman; one
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.114#must not use force with her.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.115#221. "It sometimes happens," said a moralistic pedant and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.116#trifle-retailer, "that I honour and respect an unselfish man: not,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.117#however, because he is unselfish, but because I think he has a right to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.118#be useful to another man at his own expense. In short, the question
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.119#is always who HE is, and who THE OTHER is. For instance, in a person
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.120#created and destined for command, self-denial and modest retirement,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.121#instead of being virtues, would be the waste of virtues: so it seems
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.122#to me. Every system of unegoistic morality which takes itself
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.123#unconditionally and appeals to every one, not only sins against good
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.124#taste, but is also an incentive to sins of omission, an ADDITIONAL
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.125#seduction under the mask of philanthropy--and precisely a seduction and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.126#injury to the higher, rarer, and more privileged types of men. Moral
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.127#systems must be compelled first of all to bow before the GRADATIONS OF
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.128#RANK; their presumption must be driven home to their conscience--until
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.129#they thoroughly understand at last that it is IMMORAL to say that 'what
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.130#is right for one is proper for another.'"--So said my moralistic pedant
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.131#and bonhomme. Did he perhaps deserve to be laughed at when he thus
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.132#exhorted systems of morals to practise morality? But one should not be
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.133#too much in the right if one wishes to have the laughers on ONE'S OWN
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.134#side; a grain of wrong pertains even to good taste.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.135#222. Wherever sympathy (fellow-suffering) is preached nowadays--and,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.136#if I gather rightly, no other religion is any longer preached--let the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.137#psychologist have his ears open through all the vanity, through all the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.138#noise which is natural to these preachers (as to all preachers), he will
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.139#hear a hoarse, groaning, genuine note of SELF-CONTEMPT. It belongs
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.140#to the overshadowing and uglifying of Europe, which has been on
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.141#the increase for a century (the first symptoms of which are already
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.142#specified documentarily in a thoughtful letter of Galiani to Madame
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.143#d'Epinay)--IF IT IS NOT REALLY THE CAUSE THEREOF! The man of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.144#"modern ideas," the conceited ape, is excessively dissatisfied with
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.145#himself--this is perfectly certain. He suffers, and his vanity wants him
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.146#only "to suffer with his fellows."
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.147#223. The hybrid European--a tolerably ugly plebeian, taken all in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.148#all--absolutely requires a costume: he needs history as a storeroom
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.149#of costumes. To be sure, he notices that none of the costumes fit him
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.150#properly--he changes and changes. Let us look at the nineteenth century
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.151#with respect to these hasty preferences and changes in its masquerades
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.152#of style, and also with respect to its moments of desperation on account
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.153#of "nothing suiting" us. It is in vain to get ourselves up as romantic,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.154#or classical, or Christian, or Florentine, or barocco, or "national,"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.155#in moribus et artibus: it does not "clothe us"! But the "spirit,"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.156#especially the "historical spirit," profits even by this desperation:
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.157#once and again a new sample of the past or of the foreign is tested,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.158#put on, taken off, packed up, and above all studied--we are the first
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.159#studious age in puncto of "costumes," I mean as concerns morals,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.160#articles of belief, artistic tastes, and religions; we are prepared as
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.161#no other age has ever been for a carnival in the grand style, for the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.162#most spiritual festival--laughter and arrogance, for the transcendental
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.163#height of supreme folly and Aristophanic ridicule of the world. Perhaps
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.164#we are still discovering the domain of our invention just here, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.165#domain where even we can still be original, probably as parodists of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.166#the world's history and as God's Merry-Andrews,--perhaps, though nothing
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.167#else of the present have a future, our laughter itself may have a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.168#future!
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.169#224. The historical sense (or the capacity for divining quickly
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.170#the order of rank of the valuations according to which a people, a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.171#community, or an individual has lived, the "divining instinct" for the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.172#relationships of these valuations, for the relation of the authority
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.173#of the valuations to the authority of the operating forces),--this
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.174#historical sense, which we Europeans claim as our specialty, has come
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.175#to us in the train of the enchanting and mad semi-barbarity into which
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.176#Europe has been plunged by the democratic mingling of classes and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.177#races--it is only the nineteenth century that has recognized this
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.178#faculty as its sixth sense. Owing to this mingling, the past of every
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.179#form and mode of life, and of cultures which were formerly closely
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.180#contiguous and superimposed on one another, flows forth into us "modern
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.181#souls"; our instincts now run back in all directions, we ourselves are
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.182#a kind of chaos: in the end, as we have said, the spirit perceives its
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.183#advantage therein. By means of our semi-barbarity in body and in desire,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.184#we have secret access everywhere, such as a noble age never had; we have
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.185#access above all to the labyrinth of imperfect civilizations, and to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.186#every form of semi-barbarity that has at any time existed on earth; and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.187#in so far as the most considerable part of human civilization hitherto
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.188#has just been semi-barbarity, the "historical sense" implies almost the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.189#sense and instinct for everything, the taste and tongue for everything:
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.190#whereby it immediately proves itself to be an IGNOBLE sense. For
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.191#instance, we enjoy Homer once more: it is perhaps our happiest
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.192#acquisition that we know how to appreciate Homer, whom men of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.193#distinguished culture (as the French of the seventeenth century, like
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.194#Saint-Evremond, who reproached him for his ESPRIT VASTE, and even
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.195#Voltaire, the last echo of the century) cannot and could not so easily
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.196#appropriate--whom they scarcely permitted themselves to enjoy. The very
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.197#decided Yea and Nay of their palate, their promptly ready disgust, their
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.198#hesitating reluctance with regard to everything strange, their horror of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.199#the bad taste even of lively curiosity, and in general the averseness of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.200#every distinguished and self-sufficing culture to avow a new desire,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.201#a dissatisfaction with its own condition, or an admiration of what is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.202#strange: all this determines and disposes them unfavourably even towards
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.203#the best things of the world which are not their property or could not
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.204#become their prey--and no faculty is more unintelligible to such men
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.205#than just this historical sense, with its truckling, plebeian
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.206#curiosity. The case is not different with Shakespeare, that marvelous
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.207#Spanish-Moorish-Saxon synthesis of taste, over whom an ancient Athenian
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.208#of the circle of AEschylus would have half-killed himself with laughter
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.209#or irritation: but we--accept precisely this wild motleyness, this
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.210#medley of the most delicate, the most coarse, and the most artificial,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.211#with a secret confidence and cordiality; we enjoy it as a refinement
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.212#of art reserved expressly for us, and allow ourselves to be as little
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.213#disturbed by the repulsive fumes and the proximity of the English
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.214#populace in which Shakespeare's art and taste lives, as perhaps on
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.215#the Chiaja of Naples, where, with all our senses awake, we go our way,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.216#enchanted and voluntarily, in spite of the drain-odour of the lower
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.217#quarters of the town. That as men of the "historical sense" we have
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.218#our virtues, is not to be disputed:--we are unpretentious, unselfish,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.219#modest, brave, habituated to self-control and self-renunciation, very
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.220#grateful, very patient, very complaisant--but with all this we are
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.221#perhaps not very "tasteful." Let us finally confess it, that what is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.222#most difficult for us men of the "historical sense" to grasp, feel,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.223#taste, and love, what finds us fundamentally prejudiced and almost
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.224#hostile, is precisely the perfection and ultimate maturity in every
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.225#culture and art, the essentially noble in works and men, their moment
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.226#of smooth sea and halcyon self-sufficiency, the goldenness and coldness
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.227#which all things show that have perfected themselves. Perhaps our great
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.228#virtue of the historical sense is in necessary contrast to GOOD taste,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.229#at least to the very bad taste; and we can only evoke in ourselves
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.230#imperfectly, hesitatingly, and with compulsion the small, short, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.231#happy godsends and glorifications of human life as they shine here and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.232#there: those moments and marvelous experiences when a great power has
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.233#voluntarily come to a halt before the boundless and infinite,--when a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.234#super-abundance of refined delight has been enjoyed by a sudden checking
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.235#and petrifying, by standing firmly and planting oneself fixedly on still
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.236#trembling ground. PROPORTIONATENESS is strange to us, let us confess it
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.237#to ourselves; our itching is really the itching for the infinite, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.238#immeasurable. Like the rider on his forward panting horse, we let the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.239#reins fall before the infinite, we modern men, we semi-barbarians--and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.240#are only in OUR highest bliss when we--ARE IN MOST DANGER.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.241#225. Whether it be hedonism, pessimism, utilitarianism, or eudaemonism,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.242#all those modes of thinking which measure the worth of things according
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.243#to PLEASURE and PAIN, that is, according to accompanying circumstances
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.244#and secondary considerations, are plausible modes of thought and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.245#naivetes, which every one conscious of CREATIVE powers and an artist's
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.246#conscience will look down upon with scorn, though not without sympathy.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.247#Sympathy for you!--to be sure, that is not sympathy as you understand
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.248#it: it is not sympathy for social "distress," for "society" with its
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.249#sick and misfortuned, for the hereditarily vicious and defective who lie
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.250#on the ground around us; still less is it sympathy for the grumbling,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.251#vexed, revolutionary slave-classes who strive after power--they call it
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.252#"freedom." OUR sympathy is a loftier and further-sighted sympathy:--we
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.253#see how MAN dwarfs himself, how YOU dwarf him! and there are moments
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.254#when we view YOUR sympathy with an indescribable anguish, when we resist
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.255#it,--when we regard your seriousness as more dangerous than any kind
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.256#of levity. You want, if possible--and there is not a more foolish "if
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.257#possible"--TO DO AWAY WITH SUFFERING; and we?--it really seems that WE
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.258#would rather have it increased and made worse than it has ever been!
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.259#Well-being, as you understand it--is certainly not a goal; it seems
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.260#to us an END; a condition which at once renders man ludicrous and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.261#contemptible--and makes his destruction DESIRABLE! The discipline
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.262#of suffering, of GREAT suffering--know ye not that it is only THIS
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.263#discipline that has produced all the elevations of humanity hitherto?
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.264#The tension of soul in misfortune which communicates to it its energy,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.265#its shuddering in view of rack and ruin, its inventiveness and bravery
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.266#in undergoing, enduring, interpreting, and exploiting misfortune, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.267#whatever depth, mystery, disguise, spirit, artifice, or greatness has
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.268#been bestowed upon the soul--has it not been bestowed through suffering,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.269#through the discipline of great suffering? In man CREATURE and CREATOR
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.270#are united: in man there is not only matter, shred, excess, clay, mire,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.271#folly, chaos; but there is also the creator, the sculptor, the hardness
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.272#of the hammer, the divinity of the spectator, and the seventh day--do
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.273#ye understand this contrast? And that YOUR sympathy for the "creature
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.274#in man" applies to that which has to be fashioned, bruised, forged,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.275#stretched, roasted, annealed, refined--to that which must necessarily
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.276#SUFFER, and IS MEANT to suffer? And our sympathy--do ye not understand
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.277#what our REVERSE sympathy applies to, when it resists your sympathy as
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.278#the worst of all pampering and enervation?--So it is sympathy AGAINST
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.279#sympathy!--But to repeat it once more, there are higher problems than
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.280#the problems of pleasure and pain and sympathy; and all systems of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.281#philosophy which deal only with these are naivetes.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.282#226. WE IMMORALISTS.--This world with which WE are concerned, in which
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.283#we have to fear and love, this almost invisible, inaudible world of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.284#delicate command and delicate obedience, a world of "almost" in every
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.285#respect, captious, insidious, sharp, and tender--yes, it is well
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.286#protected from clumsy spectators and familiar curiosity! We are
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.287#woven into a strong net and garment of duties, and CANNOT disengage
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.288#ourselves--precisely here, we are "men of duty," even we! Occasionally,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.289#it is true, we dance in our "chains" and betwixt our "swords"; it
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.290#is none the less true that more often we gnash our teeth under the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.291#circumstances, and are impatient at the secret hardship of our lot. But
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.292#do what we will, fools and appearances say of us: "These are men WITHOUT
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.293#duty,"--we have always fools and appearances against us!
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.294#227. Honesty, granting that it is the virtue of which we cannot rid
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.295#ourselves, we free spirits--well, we will labour at it with all our
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.296#perversity and love, and not tire of "perfecting" ourselves in OUR
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.297#virtue, which alone remains: may its glance some day overspread like
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.298#a gilded, blue, mocking twilight this aging civilization with its dull
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.299#gloomy seriousness! And if, nevertheless, our honesty should one day
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.300#grow weary, and sigh, and stretch its limbs, and find us too hard, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.301#would fain have it pleasanter, easier, and gentler, like an agreeable
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.302#vice, let us remain HARD, we latest Stoics, and let us send to its
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.303#help whatever devilry we have in us:--our disgust at the clumsy
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.304#and undefined, our "NITIMUR IN VETITUM," our love of adventure,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.305#our sharpened and fastidious curiosity, our most subtle, disguised,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.306#intellectual Will to Power and universal conquest, which rambles and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.307#roves avidiously around all the realms of the future--let us go with all
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.308#our "devils" to the help of our "God"! It is probable that people will
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.309#misunderstand and mistake us on that account: what does it matter! They
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.310#will say: "Their 'honesty'--that is their devilry, and nothing else!"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.311#What does it matter! And even if they were right--have not all Gods
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.312#hitherto been such sanctified, re-baptized devils? And after all, what
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.313#do we know of ourselves? And what the spirit that leads us wants TO BE
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.314#CALLED? (It is a question of names.) And how many spirits we harbour?
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.315#Our honesty, we free spirits--let us be careful lest it become our
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.316#vanity, our ornament and ostentation, our limitation, our stupidity!
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.317#Every virtue inclines to stupidity, every stupidity to virtue; "stupid
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.318#to the point of sanctity," they say in Russia,--let us be careful lest
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.319#out of pure honesty we eventually become saints and bores! Is not life
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.320#a hundred times too short for us--to bore ourselves? One would have to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.321#believe in eternal life in order to...
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.322#228. I hope to be forgiven for discovering that all moral philosophy
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.323#hitherto has been tedious and has belonged to the soporific
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.324#appliances--and that "virtue," in my opinion, has been MORE injured
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.325#by the TEDIOUSNESS of its advocates than by anything else; at the same
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.326#time, however, I would not wish to overlook their general usefulness. It
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.327#is desirable that as few people as possible should reflect upon morals,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.328#and consequently it is very desirable that morals should not some day
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.329#become interesting! But let us not be afraid! Things still remain today
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.330#as they have always been: I see no one in Europe who has (or DISCLOSES)
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.331#an idea of the fact that philosophizing concerning morals might be
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.332#conducted in a dangerous, captious, and ensnaring manner--that CALAMITY
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.333#might be involved therein. Observe, for example, the indefatigable,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.334#inevitable English utilitarians: how ponderously and respectably they
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.335#stalk on, stalk along (a Homeric metaphor expresses it better) in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.336#footsteps of Bentham, just as he had already stalked in the footsteps of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.337#the respectable Helvetius! (no, he was not a dangerous man, Helvetius,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.338#CE SENATEUR POCOCURANTE, to use an expression of Galiani). No new
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.339#thought, nothing of the nature of a finer turning or better expression
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.340#of an old thought, not even a proper history of what has been previously
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.341#thought on the subject: an IMPOSSIBLE literature, taking it all in all,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.342#unless one knows how to leaven it with some mischief. In effect, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.343#old English vice called CANT, which is MORAL TARTUFFISM, has insinuated
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.344#itself also into these moralists (whom one must certainly read with an
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.345#eye to their motives if one MUST read them), concealed this time under
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.346#the new form of the scientific spirit; moreover, there is not absent
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.347#from them a secret struggle with the pangs of conscience, from which a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.348#race of former Puritans must naturally suffer, in all their scientific
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.349#tinkering with morals. (Is not a moralist the opposite of a Puritan?
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.350#That is to say, as a thinker who regards morality as questionable,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.351#as worthy of interrogation, in short, as a problem? Is moralizing
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.352#not-immoral?) In the end, they all want English morality to be
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.353#recognized as authoritative, inasmuch as mankind, or the "general
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.354#utility," or "the happiness of the greatest number,"--no! the happiness
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.355#of ENGLAND, will be best served thereby. They would like, by all means,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.356#to convince themselves that the striving after English happiness, I
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.357#mean after COMFORT and FASHION (and in the highest instance, a seat in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.358#Parliament), is at the same time the true path of virtue; in fact, that
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.359#in so far as there has been virtue in the world hitherto, it has
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.360#just consisted in such striving. Not one of those ponderous,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.361#conscience-stricken herding-animals (who undertake to advocate the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.362#cause of egoism as conducive to the general welfare) wants to have
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.363#any knowledge or inkling of the facts that the "general welfare" is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.364#no ideal, no goal, no notion that can be at all grasped, but is only a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.365#nostrum,--that what is fair to one MAY NOT at all be fair to another,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.366#that the requirement of one morality for all is really a detriment to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.367#higher men, in short, that there is a DISTINCTION OF RANK between man
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.368#and man, and consequently between morality and morality. They are an
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.369#unassuming and fundamentally mediocre species of men, these utilitarian
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.370#Englishmen, and, as already remarked, in so far as they are tedious, one
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.371#cannot think highly enough of their utility. One ought even to ENCOURAGE
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.372#them, as has been partially attempted in the following rhymes:--
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.373#    Hail, ye worthies, barrow-wheeling,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.374#    "Longer--better," aye revealing,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.375#    Stiffer aye in head and knee;
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.376#    Unenraptured, never jesting,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.377#    Mediocre everlasting,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.378#    SANS GENIE ET SANS ESPRIT!
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.379#229. In these later ages, which may be proud of their humanity, there
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.380#still remains so much fear, so much SUPERSTITION of the fear, of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.381#"cruel wild beast," the mastering of which constitutes the very pride of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.382#these humaner ages--that even obvious truths, as if by the agreement
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.383#of centuries, have long remained unuttered, because they have the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.384#appearance of helping the finally slain wild beast back to life again.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.385#I perhaps risk something when I allow such a truth to escape; let
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.386#others capture it again and give it so much "milk of pious sentiment"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.387#[FOOTNOTE: An expression from Schiller's William Tell, Act IV, Scene
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.388#3.] to drink, that it will lie down quiet and forgotten, in its old
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.389#corner.--One ought to learn anew about cruelty, and open one's eyes;
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.390#one ought at last to learn impatience, in order that such immodest
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.391#gross errors--as, for instance, have been fostered by ancient and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.392#modern philosophers with regard to tragedy--may no longer wander about
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.393#virtuously and boldly. Almost everything that we call "higher culture"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.394#is based upon the spiritualising and intensifying of CRUELTY--this is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.395#my thesis; the "wild beast" has not been slain at all, it lives, it
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.396#flourishes, it has only been--transfigured. That which constitutes the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.397#painful delight of tragedy is cruelty; that which operates agreeably in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.398#so-called tragic sympathy, and at the basis even of everything sublime,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.399#up to the highest and most delicate thrills of metaphysics, obtains its
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.400#sweetness solely from the intermingled ingredient of cruelty. What the

urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.407#ardour to drink in, is the philtre of the great Circe "cruelty." Here,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.408#to be sure, we must put aside entirely the blundering psychology of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.409#former times, which could only teach with regard to cruelty that
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.410#it originated at the sight of the suffering of OTHERS: there is an
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.411#abundant, super-abundant enjoyment even in one's own suffering, in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.412#causing one's own suffering--and wherever man has allowed himself to be
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.413#persuaded to self-denial in the RELIGIOUS sense, or to self-mutilation,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.414#as among the Phoenicians and ascetics, or in general, to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.415#desensualisation, decarnalisation, and contrition, to Puritanical
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.416#repentance-spasms, to vivisection of conscience and to Pascal-like

urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.418#forwards by his cruelty, by the dangerous thrill of cruelty TOWARDS
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.419#HIMSELF.--Finally, let us consider that even the seeker of knowledge
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.420#operates as an artist and glorifier of cruelty, in that he compels his
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.421#spirit to perceive AGAINST its own inclination, and often enough against
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.422#the wishes of his heart:--he forces it to say Nay, where he would like
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.423#to affirm, love, and adore; indeed, every instance of taking a thing
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.424#profoundly and fundamentally, is a violation, an intentional injuring
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.425#of the fundamental will of the spirit, which instinctively aims at
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.426#appearance and superficiality,--even in every desire for knowledge there
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.427#is a drop of cruelty.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.428#230. Perhaps what I have said here about a "fundamental will of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.429#spirit" may not be understood without further details; I may be allowed
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.430#a word of explanation.--That imperious something which is popularly
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.431#called "the spirit," wishes to be master internally and externally,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.432#and to feel itself master; it has the will of a multiplicity for a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.433#simplicity, a binding, taming, imperious, and essentially ruling will.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.434#Its requirements and capacities here, are the same as those assigned by
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.435#physiologists to everything that lives, grows, and multiplies. The power
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.436#of the spirit to appropriate foreign elements reveals itself in a strong
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.437#tendency to assimilate the new to the old, to simplify the manifold,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.438#to overlook or repudiate the absolutely contradictory; just as it
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.439#arbitrarily re-underlines, makes prominent, and falsifies for itself
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.440#certain traits and lines in the foreign elements, in every portion of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.441#the "outside world." Its object thereby is the incorporation of new
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.442#"experiences," the assortment of new things in the old arrangements--in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.443#short, growth; or more properly, the FEELING of growth, the feeling of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.444#increased power--is its object. This same will has at its service an
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.445#apparently opposed impulse of the spirit, a suddenly adopted preference
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.446#of ignorance, of arbitrary shutting out, a closing of windows, an inner
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.447#denial of this or that, a prohibition to approach, a sort of defensive
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.448#attitude against much that is knowable, a contentment with obscurity,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.449#with the shutting-in horizon, an acceptance and approval of ignorance:
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.450#as that which is all necessary according to the degree of its
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.451#appropriating power, its "digestive power," to speak figuratively (and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.452#in fact "the spirit" resembles a stomach more than anything else). Here
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.453#also belong an occasional propensity of the spirit to let itself be
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.454#deceived (perhaps with a waggish suspicion that it is NOT so and so,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.455#but is only allowed to pass as such), a delight in uncertainty and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.456#ambiguity, an exulting enjoyment of arbitrary, out-of-the-way narrowness
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.457#and mystery, of the too-near, of the foreground, of the magnified,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.458#the diminished, the misshapen, the beautified--an enjoyment of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.459#arbitrariness of all these manifestations of power. Finally, in this
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.460#connection, there is the not unscrupulous readiness of the spirit to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.461#deceive other spirits and dissemble before them--the constant pressing
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.462#and straining of a creating, shaping, changeable power: the spirit
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.463#enjoys therein its craftiness and its variety of disguises, it enjoys
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.464#also its feeling of security therein--it is precisely by its Protean
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.465#arts that it is best protected and concealed!--COUNTER TO this
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.466#propensity for appearance, for simplification, for a disguise, for a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.467#cloak, in short, for an outside--for every outside is a cloak--there
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.468#operates the sublime tendency of the man of knowledge, which takes, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.469#INSISTS on taking things profoundly, variously, and thoroughly; as a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.470#kind of cruelty of the intellectual conscience and taste, which every
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.471#courageous thinker will acknowledge in himself, provided, as it ought
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.472#to be, that he has sharpened and hardened his eye sufficiently long for
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.473#introspection, and is accustomed to severe discipline and even severe
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.474#words. He will say: "There is something cruel in the tendency of my
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.475#spirit": let the virtuous and amiable try to convince him that it is not
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.476#so! In fact, it would sound nicer, if, instead of our cruelty, perhaps
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.477#our "extravagant honesty" were talked about, whispered about, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.478#glorified--we free, VERY free spirits--and some day perhaps SUCH will
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.479#actually be our--posthumous glory! Meanwhile--for there is plenty of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.480#time until then--we should be least inclined to deck ourselves out in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.481#such florid and fringed moral verbiage; our whole former work has
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.482#just made us sick of this taste and its sprightly exuberance. They are
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.483#beautiful, glistening, jingling, festive words: honesty, love of truth,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.484#love of wisdom, sacrifice for knowledge, heroism of the truthful--there
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.485#is something in them that makes one's heart swell with pride. But we
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.486#anchorites and marmots have long ago persuaded ourselves in all the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.487#secrecy of an anchorite's conscience, that this worthy parade of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.488#verbiage also belongs to the old false adornment, frippery, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.489#gold-dust of unconscious human vanity, and that even under such
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.490#flattering colour and repainting, the terrible original text HOMO NATURA
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.491#must again be recognized. In effect, to translate man back again into
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.492#nature; to master the many vain and visionary interpretations and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.493#subordinate meanings which have hitherto been scratched and daubed over
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.494#the eternal original text, HOMO NATURA; to bring it about that man shall
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.495#henceforth stand before man as he now, hardened by the discipline
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.496#of science, stands before the OTHER forms of nature, with fearless
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.497#Oedipus-eyes, and stopped Ulysses-ears, deaf to the enticements of old
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.498#metaphysical bird-catchers, who have piped to him far too long: "Thou
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.499#art more! thou art higher! thou hast a different origin!"--this may be
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.500#a strange and foolish task, but that it is a TASK, who can deny! Why did
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.501#we choose it, this foolish task? Or, to put the question differently:
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.502#"Why knowledge at all?" Every one will ask us about this. And thus
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.503#pressed, we, who have asked ourselves the question a hundred times, have
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.504#not found and cannot find any better answer....
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.505#231. Learning alters us, it does what all nourishment does that does not
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.506#merely "conserve"--as the physiologist knows. But at the bottom of our
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.507#souls, quite "down below," there is certainly something unteachable,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.508#a granite of spiritual fate, of predetermined decision and answer to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.509#predetermined, chosen questions. In each cardinal problem there speaks
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.510#an unchangeable "I am this"; a thinker cannot learn anew about man and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.511#woman, for instance, but can only learn fully--he can only follow to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.512#end what is "fixed" about them in himself. Occasionally we find certain
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.513#solutions of problems which make strong beliefs for us; perhaps they
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.514#are henceforth called "convictions." Later on--one sees in them only
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.515#footsteps to self-knowledge, guide-posts to the problem which we
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.516#ourselves ARE--or more correctly to the great stupidity which we embody,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.517#our spiritual fate, the UNTEACHABLE in us, quite "down below."--In view
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.518#of this liberal compliment which I have just paid myself, permission
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.519#will perhaps be more readily allowed me to utter some truths about
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.520#"woman as she is," provided that it is known at the outset how literally
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.521#they are merely--MY truths.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.522#232. Woman wishes to be independent, and therefore she begins to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.523#enlighten men about "woman as she is"--THIS is one of the worst
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.524#developments of the general UGLIFYING of Europe. For what must these
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.525#clumsy attempts of feminine scientificality and self-exposure bring
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.526#to light! Woman has so much cause for shame; in woman there is so
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.527#much pedantry, superficiality, schoolmasterliness, petty presumption,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.528#unbridledness, and indiscretion concealed--study only woman's behaviour
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.529#towards children!--which has really been best restrained and dominated
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.530#hitherto by the FEAR of man. Alas, if ever the "eternally tedious in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.531#woman"--she has plenty of it!--is allowed to venture forth! if she
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.532#begins radically and on principle to unlearn her wisdom and art-of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.533#charming, of playing, of frightening away sorrow, of alleviating and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.534#taking easily; if she forgets her delicate aptitude for agreeable
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.535#desires! Female voices are already raised, which, by Saint Aristophanes!
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.536#make one afraid:--with medical explicitness it is stated in a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.537#threatening manner what woman first and last REQUIRES from man. Is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.538#it not in the very worst taste that woman thus sets herself up to be
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.539#scientific? Enlightenment hitherto has fortunately been men's affair,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.540#men's gift--we remained therewith "among ourselves"; and in the end,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.541#in view of all that women write about "woman," we may well have
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.542#considerable doubt as to whether woman really DESIRES enlightenment
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.543#about herself--and CAN desire it. If woman does not thereby seek a new
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.544#ORNAMENT for herself--I believe ornamentation belongs to the eternally
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.545#feminine?--why, then, she wishes to make herself feared: perhaps she
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.546#thereby wishes to get the mastery. But she does not want truth--what
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.547#does woman care for truth? From the very first, nothing is more foreign,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.548#more repugnant, or more hostile to woman than truth--her great art is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.549#falsehood, her chief concern is appearance and beauty. Let us confess
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.550#it, we men: we honour and love this very art and this very instinct in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.551#woman: we who have the hard task, and for our recreation gladly seek the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.552#company of beings under whose hands, glances, and delicate follies, our
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.553#seriousness, our gravity, and profundity appear almost like follies to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.554#us. Finally, I ask the question: Did a woman herself ever acknowledge
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.555#profundity in a woman's mind, or justice in a woman's heart? And is it
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.556#not true that on the whole "woman" has hitherto been most despised by
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.557#woman herself, and not at all by us?--We men desire that woman should
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.558#not continue to compromise herself by enlightening us; just as it was
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.559#man's care and the consideration for woman, when the church decreed:
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.560#mulier taceat in ecclesia. It was to the benefit of woman when Napoleon
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.561#gave the too eloquent Madame de Stael to understand: mulier taceat in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.562#politicis!--and in my opinion, he is a true friend of woman who calls
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.563#out to women today: mulier taceat de mulierel.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.564#233. It betrays corruption of the instincts--apart from the fact that
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.565#it betrays bad taste--when a woman refers to Madame Roland, or Madame de
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.566#Stael, or Monsieur George Sand, as though something were proved thereby
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.567#in favour of "woman as she is." Among men, these are the three comical
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.568#women as they are--nothing more!--and just the best involuntary
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.569#counter-arguments against feminine emancipation and autonomy.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.570#234. Stupidity in the kitchen; woman as cook; the terrible
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.571#thoughtlessness with which the feeding of the family and the master of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.572#the house is managed! Woman does not understand what food means, and she
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.573#insists on being cook! If woman had been a thinking creature, she should
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.574#certainly, as cook for thousands of years, have discovered the most
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.575#important physiological facts, and should likewise have got possession
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.576#of the healing art! Through bad female cooks--through the entire lack
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.577#of reason in the kitchen--the development of mankind has been longest
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.578#retarded and most interfered with: even today matters are very little
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.579#better. A word to High School girls.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.580#235. There are turns and casts of fancy, there are sentences, little
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.581#handfuls of words, in which a whole culture, a whole society suddenly
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.582#crystallises itself. Among these is the incidental remark of Madame de
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.583#Lambert to her son: "MON AMI, NE VOUS PERMETTEZ JAMAIS QUE DES FOLIES,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.584#QUI VOUS FERONT GRAND PLAISIR"--the motherliest and wisest remark, by
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.585#the way, that was ever addressed to a son.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.586#236. I have no doubt that every noble woman will oppose what Dante and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.587#Goethe believed about woman--the former when he sang, "ELLA GUARDAVA
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.588#SUSO, ED IO IN LEI," and the latter when he interpreted it, "the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.589#eternally feminine draws us ALOFT"; for THIS is just what she believes
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.590#of the eternally masculine.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.591#237.

urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.602#delicate, fragile, wild, strange, sweet, and animating--but as something
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.603#also which must be cooped up to prevent it flying away.

urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.612#present, and will be unable to descend into ANY of the depths. On the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.613#other hand, a man who has depth of spirit as well as of desires, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.614#has also the depth of benevolence which is capable of severity and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.615#harshness, and easily confounded with them, can only think of woman as
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.616#ORIENTALS do: he must conceive of her as a possession, as confinable
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.617#property, as a being predestined for service and accomplishing her
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.618#mission therein--he must take his stand in this matter upon the immense
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.619#rationality of Asia, upon the superiority of the instinct of Asia, as
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.620#the Greeks did formerly; those best heirs and scholars of Asia--who,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.621#as is well known, with their INCREASING culture and amplitude of power,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.622#from Homer to the time of Pericles, became gradually STRICTER towards
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.623#woman, in short, more Oriental. HOW necessary, HOW logical, even HOW
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.624#humanely desirable this was, let us consider for ourselves!
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.625#239. The weaker sex has in no previous age been treated with so
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.626#much respect by men as at present--this belongs to the tendency and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.627#fundamental taste of democracy, in the same way as disrespectfulness to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.628#old age--what wonder is it that abuse should be immediately made of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.629#this respect? They want more, they learn to make claims, the tribute
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.630#of respect is at last felt to be well-nigh galling; rivalry for rights,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.631#indeed actual strife itself, would be preferred: in a word, woman is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.632#losing modesty. And let us immediately add that she is also losing
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.633#taste. She is unlearning to FEAR man: but the woman who "unlearns to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.634#fear" sacrifices her most womanly instincts. That woman should venture
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.635#forward when the fear-inspiring quality in man--or more definitely,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.636#the MAN in man--is no longer either desired or fully developed, is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.637#reasonable enough and also intelligible enough; what is more difficult
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.638#to understand is that precisely thereby--woman deteriorates. This is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.639#what is happening nowadays: let us not deceive ourselves about it!
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.640#Wherever the industrial spirit has triumphed over the military
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.641#and aristocratic spirit, woman strives for the economic and legal
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.642#independence of a clerk: "woman as clerkess" is inscribed on the portal
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.643#of the modern society which is in course of formation. While she
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.644#thus appropriates new rights, aspires to be "master," and inscribes
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.645#"progress" of woman on her flags and banners, the very opposite realises
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.646#itself with terrible obviousness: WOMAN RETROGRADES. Since the French
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.647#Revolution the influence of woman in Europe has DECLINED in proportion
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.648#as she has increased her rights and claims; and the "emancipation of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.649#woman," insofar as it is desired and demanded by women themselves (and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.650#not only by masculine shallow-pates), thus proves to be a remarkable
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.651#symptom of the increased weakening and deadening of the most womanly
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.652#instincts. There is STUPIDITY in this movement, an almost masculine
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.653#stupidity, of which a well-reared woman--who is always a sensible
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.654#woman--might be heartily ashamed. To lose the intuition as to the ground
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.655#upon which she can most surely achieve victory; to neglect exercise in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.656#the use of her proper weapons; to let-herself-go before man, perhaps
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.657#even "to the book," where formerly she kept herself in control and in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.658#refined, artful humility; to neutralize with her virtuous audacity man's
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.659#faith in a VEILED, fundamentally different ideal in woman, something
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.660#eternally, necessarily feminine; to emphatically and loquaciously
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.661#dissuade man from the idea that woman must be preserved, cared for,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.662#protected, and indulged, like some delicate, strangely wild, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.663#often pleasant domestic animal; the clumsy and indignant collection of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.664#everything of the nature of servitude and bondage which the position of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.665#woman in the hitherto existing order of society has entailed and still
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.666#entails (as though slavery were a counter-argument, and not rather a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.667#condition of every higher culture, of every elevation of culture):--what
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.668#does all this betoken, if not a disintegration of womanly instincts,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.669#a defeminising? Certainly, there are enough of idiotic friends and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.670#corrupters of woman among the learned asses of the masculine sex, who
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.671#advise woman to defeminize herself in this manner, and to imitate
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.672#all the stupidities from which "man" in Europe, European "manliness,"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.673#suffers,--who would like to lower woman to "general culture," indeed
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.674#even to newspaper reading and meddling with politics. Here and there
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.675#they wish even to make women into free spirits and literary workers: as
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.676#though a woman without piety would not be something perfectly obnoxious
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.677#or ludicrous to a profound and godless man;--almost everywhere her
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.678#nerves are being ruined by the most morbid and dangerous kind of music
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.679#(our latest German music), and she is daily being made more hysterical
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.680#and more incapable of fulfilling her first and last function, that of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.681#bearing robust children. They wish to "cultivate" her in general still
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.682#more, and intend, as they say, to make the "weaker sex" STRONG by
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.683#culture: as if history did not teach in the most emphatic manner that
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.684#the "cultivating" of mankind and his weakening--that is to say, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.685#weakening, dissipating, and languishing of his FORCE OF WILL--have
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.686#always kept pace with one another, and that the most powerful and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.687#influential women in the world (and lastly, the mother of Napoleon)
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.688#had just to thank their force of will--and not their schoolmasters--for
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.689#their power and ascendancy over men. That which inspires respect
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.690#in woman, and often enough fear also, is her NATURE, which is more
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.691#"natural" than that of man, her genuine, carnivora-like, cunning
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.692#flexibility, her tiger-claws beneath the glove, her NAIVETE in egoism,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.693#her untrainableness and innate wildness, the incomprehensibleness,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.694#extent, and deviation of her desires and virtues. That which, in spite
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.695#of fear, excites one's sympathy for the dangerous and beautiful cat,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.696#"woman," is that she seems more afflicted, more vulnerable, more
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.697#necessitous of love, and more condemned to disillusionment than any
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.698#other creature. Fear and sympathy it is with these feelings that man has
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.699#hitherto stood in the presence of woman, always with one foot already in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.700#tragedy, which rends while it delights--What? And all that is now to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.701#be at an end? And the DISENCHANTMENT of woman is in progress? The
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.702#tediousness of woman is slowly evolving? Oh Europe! Europe! We know
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.703#the horned animal which was always most attractive to thee, from which
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.704#danger is ever again threatening thee! Thy old fable might once more
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.705#become "history"--an immense stupidity might once again overmaster
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.706#thee and carry thee away! And no God concealed beneath it--no! only an
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:7.707#"idea," a "modern idea"!
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.1#CHAPTER VIII. PEOPLES AND COUNTRIES
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.2#240. I HEARD, once again for the first time, Richard Wagner's overture
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.3#to the Mastersinger: it is a piece of magnificent, gorgeous, heavy,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.4#latter-day art, which has the pride to presuppose two centuries of music
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.5#as still living, in order that it may be understood:--it is an honour
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.6#to Germans that such a pride did not miscalculate! What flavours
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.7#and forces, what seasons and climes do we not find mingled in it! It
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.8#impresses us at one time as ancient, at another time as foreign, bitter,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.9#and too modern, it is as arbitrary as it is pompously traditional, it
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.10#is not infrequently roguish, still oftener rough and coarse--it has fire
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.11#and courage, and at the same time the loose, dun-coloured skin of fruits
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.12#which ripen too late. It flows broad and full: and suddenly there is a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.13#moment of inexplicable hesitation, like a gap that opens between cause
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.14#and effect, an oppression that makes us dream, almost a nightmare; but
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.15#already it broadens and widens anew, the old stream of delight--the most
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.16#manifold delight,--of old and new happiness; including ESPECIALLY
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.17#the joy of the artist in himself, which he refuses to conceal, his
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.18#astonished, happy cognizance of his mastery of the expedients here
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.19#employed, the new, newly acquired, imperfectly tested expedients of art
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.20#which he apparently betrays to us. All in all, however, no beauty, no
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.21#South, nothing of the delicate southern clearness of the sky, nothing
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.22#of grace, no dance, hardly a will to logic; a certain clumsiness even,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.23#which is also emphasized, as though the artist wished to say to us: "It
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.24#is part of my intention"; a cumbersome drapery, something arbitrarily
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.25#barbaric and ceremonious, a flirring of learned and venerable conceits
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.26#and witticisms; something German in the best and worst sense of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.27#the word, something in the German style, manifold, formless, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.28#inexhaustible; a certain German potency and super-plenitude of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.29#soul, which is not afraid to hide itself under the RAFFINEMENTS of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.30#decadence--which, perhaps, feels itself most at ease there; a real,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.31#genuine token of the German soul, which is at the same time young and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.32#aged, too ripe and yet still too rich in futurity. This kind of music
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.33#expresses best what I think of the Germans: they belong to the day
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.34#before yesterday and the day after tomorrow--THEY HAVE AS YET NO TODAY.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.35#241. We "good Europeans," we also have hours when we allow ourselves a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.36#warm-hearted patriotism, a plunge and relapse into old loves and narrow
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.37#views--I have just given an example of it--hours of national excitement,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.38#of patriotic anguish, and all other sorts of old-fashioned floods of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.39#sentiment. Duller spirits may perhaps only get done with what confines
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.40#its operations in us to hours and plays itself out in hours--in a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.41#considerable time: some in half a year, others in half a lifetime,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.42#according to the speed and strength with which they digest and "change
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.43#their material." Indeed, I could think of sluggish, hesitating races,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.44#which even in our rapidly moving Europe, would require half a century
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.45#ere they could surmount such atavistic attacks of patriotism and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.46#soil-attachment, and return once more to reason, that is to say, to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.47#"good Europeanism." And while digressing on this possibility, I
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.48#happen to become an ear-witness of a conversation between two old
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.49#patriots--they were evidently both hard of hearing and consequently
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.50#spoke all the louder. "HE has as much, and knows as much, philosophy as
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.51#a peasant or a corps-student," said the one--"he is still innocent. But
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.52#what does that matter nowadays! It is the age of the masses: they lie on
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.53#their belly before everything that is massive. And so also in politicis.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.54#A statesman who rears up for them a new Tower of Babel, some monstrosity
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.55#of empire and power, they call 'great'--what does it matter that we more
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.56#prudent and conservative ones do not meanwhile give up the old belief
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.57#that it is only the great thought that gives greatness to an action or
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.58#affair. Supposing a statesman were to bring his people into the position
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.59#of being obliged henceforth to practise 'high politics,' for which they
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.60#were by nature badly endowed and prepared, so that they would have
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.61#to sacrifice their old and reliable virtues, out of love to a new and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.62#doubtful mediocrity;--supposing a statesman were to condemn his people
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.63#generally to 'practise politics,' when they have hitherto had something
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.64#better to do and think about, and when in the depths of their souls
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.65#they have been unable to free themselves from a prudent loathing of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.66#the restlessness, emptiness, and noisy wranglings of the essentially
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.67#politics-practising nations;--supposing such a statesman were to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.68#stimulate the slumbering passions and avidities of his people, were to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.69#make a stigma out of their former diffidence and delight in aloofness,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.70#an offence out of their exoticism and hidden permanency, were to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.71#depreciate their most radical proclivities, subvert their consciences,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.72#make their minds narrow, and their tastes 'national'--what! a statesman
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.73#who should do all this, which his people would have to do penance for
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.74#throughout their whole future, if they had a future, such a statesman
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.75#would be GREAT, would he?"--"Undoubtedly!" replied the other old patriot
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.76#vehemently, "otherwise he COULD NOT have done it! It was mad perhaps to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.77#wish such a thing! But perhaps everything great has been just as mad
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.78#at its commencement!"--"Misuse of words!" cried his interlocutor,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.79#contradictorily--"strong! strong! Strong and mad! NOT great!"--The old
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.80#men had obviously become heated as they thus shouted their "truths" in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.81#each other's faces, but I, in my happiness and apartness, considered how
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.82#soon a stronger one may become master of the strong, and also that
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.83#there is a compensation for the intellectual superficialising of a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.84#nation--namely, in the deepening of another.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.85#242. Whether we call it "civilization," or "humanising," or "progress,"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.86#which now distinguishes the European, whether we call it simply, without
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.87#praise or blame, by the political formula the DEMOCRATIC movement in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.88#Europe--behind all the moral and political foregrounds pointed to by
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.89#such formulas, an immense PHYSIOLOGICAL PROCESS goes on, which is ever
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.90#extending the process of the assimilation of Europeans, their
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.91#increasing detachment from the conditions under which, climatically and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.92#hereditarily, united races originate, their increasing independence of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.93#every definite milieu, that for centuries would fain inscribe itself
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.94#with equal demands on soul and body,--that is to say, the slow emergence
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.95#of an essentially SUPER-NATIONAL and nomadic species of man, who
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.96#possesses, physiologically speaking, a maximum of the art and power
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.97#of adaptation as his typical distinction. This process of the EVOLVING
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.98#EUROPEAN, which can be retarded in its TEMPO by great relapses, but
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.99#will perhaps just gain and grow thereby in vehemence and depth--the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.100#still-raging storm and stress of "national sentiment" pertains to it,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.101#and also the anarchism which is appearing at present--this process
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.102#will probably arrive at results on which its naive propagators and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.103#panegyrists, the apostles of "modern ideas," would least care to reckon.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.104#The same new conditions under which on an average a levelling and

urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.107#suitable to give rise to exceptional men of the most dangerous and

urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.111#impossible; while the collective impression of such future Europeans
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.112#will probably be that of numerous, talkative, weak-willed, and very

urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.118#been before--owing to the unprejudicedness of his schooling, owing to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.119#the immense variety of practice, art, and disguise. I meant to say
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.120#that the democratising of Europe is at the same time an involuntary
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.121#arrangement for the rearing of TYRANTS--taking the word in all its
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.122#meanings, even in its most spiritual sense.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.123#243. I hear with pleasure that our sun is moving rapidly towards the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.124#constellation Hercules: and I hope that the men on this earth will do
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.125#like the sun. And we foremost, we good Europeans!
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.126#244. There was a time when it was customary to call Germans "deep"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.127#by way of distinction; but now that the most successful type of new
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.128#Germanism is covetous of quite other honours, and perhaps misses
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.129#"smartness" in all that has depth, it is almost opportune and patriotic
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.130#to doubt whether we did not formerly deceive ourselves with that
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.131#commendation: in short, whether German depth is not at bottom something
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.132#different and worse--and something from which, thank God, we are on the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.133#point of successfully ridding ourselves. Let us try, then, to relearn
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.134#with regard to German depth; the only thing necessary for the purpose is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.135#a little vivisection of the German soul.--The German soul is above all
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.136#manifold, varied in its source, aggregated and super-imposed, rather
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.137#than actually built: this is owing to its origin. A German who would
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.138#embolden himself to assert: "Two souls, alas, dwell in my breast," would
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.139#make a bad guess at the truth, or, more correctly, he would come far
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.140#short of the truth about the number of souls. As a people made up of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.141#the most extraordinary mixing and mingling of races, perhaps even with a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.142#preponderance of the pre-Aryan element as the "people of the centre" in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.143#every sense of the term, the Germans are more intangible, more ample,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.144#more contradictory, more unknown, more incalculable, more surprising,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.145#and even more terrifying than other peoples are to themselves:--they
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.146#escape DEFINITION, and are thereby alone the despair of the French. It
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.147#IS characteristic of the Germans that the question: "What is German?"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.148#never dies out among them. Kotzebue certainly knew his Germans well
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.149#enough: "We are known," they cried jubilantly to him--but Sand also
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.150#thought he knew them. Jean Paul knew what he was doing when he declared
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.151#himself incensed at Fichte's lying but patriotic flatteries and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.152#exaggerations,--but it is probable that Goethe thought differently about
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.153#Germans from Jean Paul, even though he acknowledged him to be right with
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.154#regard to Fichte. It is a question what Goethe really thought about the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.155#Germans?--But about many things around him he never spoke explicitly,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.156#and all his life he knew how to keep an astute silence--probably he
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.157#had good reason for it. It is certain that it was not the "Wars of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.158#Independence" that made him look up more joyfully, any more than it was
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.159#the French Revolution,--the event on account of which he RECONSTRUCTED
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.160#his "Faust," and indeed the whole problem of "man," was the appearance
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.161#of Napoleon. There are words of Goethe in which he condemns with
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.162#impatient severity, as from a foreign land, that which Germans take a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.163#pride in, he once defined the famous German turn of mind as "Indulgence
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.164#towards its own and others' weaknesses." Was he wrong? it is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.165#characteristic of Germans that one is seldom entirely wrong about them.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.166#The German soul has passages and galleries in it, there are caves,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.167#hiding-places, and dungeons therein, its disorder has much of the charm
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.168#of the mysterious, the German is well acquainted with the bypaths to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.169#chaos. And as everything loves its symbol, so the German loves the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.170#clouds and all that is obscure, evolving, crepuscular, damp, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.171#shrouded, it seems to him that everything uncertain, undeveloped,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.172#self-displacing, and growing is "deep". The German himself does not
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.173#EXIST, he is BECOMING, he is "developing himself". "Development" is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.174#therefore the essentially German discovery and hit in the great domain
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.175#of philosophical formulas,--a ruling idea, which, together with German
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.176#beer and German music, is labouring to Germanise all Europe. Foreigners
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.177#are astonished and attracted by the riddles which the conflicting nature
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.178#at the basis of the German soul propounds to them (riddles which
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.179#Hegel systematised and Richard Wagner has in the end set to music).
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.180#"Good-natured and spiteful"--such a juxtaposition, preposterous in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.181#case of every other people, is unfortunately only too often justified
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.182#in Germany one has only to live for a while among Swabians to know this!
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.183#The clumsiness of the German scholar and his social distastefulness
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.184#agree alarmingly well with his physical rope-dancing and nimble
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.185#boldness, of which all the Gods have learnt to be afraid. If any one
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.186#wishes to see the "German soul" demonstrated ad oculos, let him
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.187#only look at German taste, at German arts and manners what boorish
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.188#indifference to "taste"! How the noblest and the commonest stand there
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.189#in juxtaposition! How disorderly and how rich is the whole constitution
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.190#of this soul! The German DRAGS at his soul, he drags at everything he
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.191#experiences. He digests his events badly; he never gets "done"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.192#with them; and German depth is often only a difficult, hesitating
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.193#"digestion." And just as all chronic invalids, all dyspeptics like what
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.194#is convenient, so the German loves "frankness" and "honesty"; it is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.195#so CONVENIENT to be frank and honest!--This confidingness, this
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.196#complaisance, this showing-the-cards of German HONESTY, is probably the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.197#most dangerous and most successful disguise which the German is up to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.198#nowadays: it is his proper Mephistophelean art; with this he can "still
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.199#achieve much"! The German lets himself go, and thereby gazes with
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.200#faithful, blue, empty German eyes--and other countries immediately
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.201#confound him with his dressing-gown!--I meant to say that, let "German
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.202#depth" be what it will--among ourselves alone we perhaps take the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.203#liberty to laugh at it--we shall do well to continue henceforth to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.204#honour its appearance and good name, and not barter away too cheaply our
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.205#old reputation as a people of depth for Prussian "smartness," and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.206#Berlin wit and sand. It is wise for a people to pose, and LET itself
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.207#be regarded, as profound, clumsy, good-natured, honest, and foolish: it
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.208#might even be--profound to do so! Finally, we should do honour to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.209#our name--we are not called the "TIUSCHE VOLK" (deceptive people) for
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.210#nothing....
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.211#245. The "good old" time is past, it sang itself out in Mozart--how
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.212#happy are WE that his ROCOCO still speaks to us, that his "good
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.213#company," his tender enthusiasm, his childish delight in the Chinese and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.214#its flourishes, his courtesy of heart, his longing for the elegant, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.215#amorous, the tripping, the tearful, and his belief in the South, can
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.216#still appeal to SOMETHING LEFT in us! Ah, some time or other it will be
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.217#over with it!--but who can doubt that it will be over still sooner with
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.218#the intelligence and taste for Beethoven! For he was only the last echo
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.219#of a break and transition in style, and NOT, like Mozart, the last echo
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.220#of a great European taste which had existed for centuries. Beethoven
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.221#is the intermediate event between an old mellow soul that is constantly
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.222#breaking down, and a future over-young soul that is always COMING;
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.223#there is spread over his music the twilight of eternal loss and eternal
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.224#extravagant hope,--the same light in which Europe was bathed when it
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.225#dreamed with Rousseau, when it danced round the Tree of Liberty of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.226#Revolution, and finally almost fell down in adoration before Napoleon.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.227#But how rapidly does THIS very sentiment now pale, how difficult
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.228#nowadays is even the APPREHENSION of this sentiment, how strangely does
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.229#the language of Rousseau, Schiller, Shelley, and Byron sound to our ear,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.230#in whom COLLECTIVELY the same fate of Europe was able to SPEAK, which
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.231#knew how to SING in Beethoven!--Whatever German music came afterwards,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.232#belongs to Romanticism, that is to say, to a movement which,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.233#historically considered, was still shorter, more fleeting, and more
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.234#superficial than that great interlude, the transition of Europe from
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.235#Rousseau to Napoleon, and to the rise of democracy. Weber--but what do
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.236#WE care nowadays for "Freischutz" and "Oberon"! Or Marschner's "Hans
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.237#Heiling" and "Vampyre"! Or even Wagner's "Tannhauser"! That is extinct,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.238#although not yet forgotten music. This whole music of Romanticism,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.239#besides, was not noble enough, was not musical enough, to maintain its
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.240#position anywhere but in the theatre and before the masses; from the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.241#beginning it was second-rate music, which was little thought of by
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.242#genuine musicians. It was different with Felix Mendelssohn, that halcyon
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.243#master, who, on account of his lighter, purer, happier soul, quickly
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.244#acquired admiration, and was equally quickly forgotten: as the beautiful
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.245#EPISODE of German music. But with regard to Robert Schumann, who took
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.246#things seriously, and has been taken seriously from the first--he
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.247#was the last that founded a school,--do we not now regard it as a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.248#satisfaction, a relief, a deliverance, that this very Romanticism
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.249#of Schumann's has been surmounted? Schumann, fleeing into the "Saxon
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.250#Switzerland" of his soul, with a half Werther-like, half Jean-Paul-like
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.251#nature (assuredly not like Beethoven! assuredly not like Byron!)--his
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.252#MANFRED music is a mistake and a misunderstanding to the extent of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.253#injustice; Schumann, with his taste, which was fundamentally a PETTY
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.254#taste (that is to say, a dangerous propensity--doubly dangerous among
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.255#Germans--for quiet lyricism and intoxication of the feelings), going
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.256#constantly apart, timidly withdrawing and retiring, a noble weakling who
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.257#revelled in nothing but anonymous joy and sorrow, from the beginning
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.258#a sort of girl and NOLI ME TANGERE--this Schumann was already merely a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.259#GERMAN event in music, and no longer a European event, as Beethoven had
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.260#been, as in a still greater degree Mozart had been; with Schumann German
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.261#music was threatened with its greatest danger, that of LOSING THE VOICE
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.262#FOR THE SOUL OF EUROPE and sinking into a merely national affair.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.263#246. What a torture are books written in German to a reader who has a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.264#THIRD ear! How indignantly he stands beside the slowly turning swamp
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.265#of sounds without tune and rhythms without dance, which Germans call
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.266#a "book"! And even the German who READS books! How lazily, how
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.267#reluctantly, how badly he reads! How many Germans know, and consider it
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.268#obligatory to know, that there is ART in every good sentence--art which
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.269#must be divined, if the sentence is to be understood! If there is a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.270#misunderstanding about its TEMPO, for instance, the sentence itself
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.271#is misunderstood! That one must not be doubtful about the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.272#rhythm-determining syllables, that one should feel the breaking of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.273#too-rigid symmetry as intentional and as a charm, that one should lend a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.274#fine and patient ear to every STACCATO and every RUBATO, that one should
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.275#divine the sense in the sequence of the vowels and diphthongs, and how
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.276#delicately and richly they can be tinted and retinted in the order of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.277#their arrangement--who among book-reading Germans is complaisant enough
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.278#to recognize such duties and requirements, and to listen to so much art
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.279#and intention in language? After all, one just "has no ear for it";
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.280#and so the most marked contrasts of style are not heard, and the most
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.281#delicate artistry is as it were SQUANDERED on the deaf.--These were my
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.282#thoughts when I noticed how clumsily and unintuitively two masters in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.283#the art of prose-writing have been confounded: one, whose words drop
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.284#down hesitatingly and coldly, as from the roof of a damp cave--he counts
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.285#on their dull sound and echo; and another who manipulates his language
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.286#like a flexible sword, and from his arm down into his toes feels the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.287#dangerous bliss of the quivering, over-sharp blade, which wishes to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.288#bite, hiss, and cut.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.289#247. How little the German style has to do with harmony and with the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.290#ear, is shown by the fact that precisely our good musicians themselves
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.291#write badly. The German does not read aloud, he does not read for the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.292#ear, but only with his eyes; he has put his ears away in the drawer for
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.293#the time. In antiquity when a man read--which was seldom enough--he read
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.294#something to himself, and in a loud voice; they were surprised when
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.295#any one read silently, and sought secretly the reason of it. In a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.296#loud voice: that is to say, with all the swellings, inflections, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.297#variations of key and changes of TEMPO, in which the ancient PUBLIC
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.298#world took delight. The laws of the written style were then the same
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.299#as those of the spoken style; and these laws depended partly on the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.300#surprising development and refined requirements of the ear and larynx;
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.301#partly on the strength, endurance, and power of the ancient lungs. In
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.302#the ancient sense, a period is above all a physiological whole, inasmuch
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.303#as it is comprised in one breath. Such periods as occur in Demosthenes
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.304#and Cicero, swelling twice and sinking twice, and all in one breath,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.305#were pleasures to the men of ANTIQUITY, who knew by their own schooling
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.306#how to appreciate the virtue therein, the rareness and the difficulty
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.307#in the deliverance of such a period;--WE have really no right to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.308#BIG period, we modern men, who are short of breath in every sense! Those
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.309#ancients, indeed, were all of them dilettanti in speaking, consequently
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.310#connoisseurs, consequently critics--they thus brought their orators to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.311#the highest pitch; in the same manner as in the last century, when all
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.312#Italian ladies and gentlemen knew how to sing, the virtuosoship of song
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.313#(and with it also the art of melody) reached its elevation. In Germany,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.314#however (until quite recently when a kind of platform eloquence began
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.315#shyly and awkwardly enough to flutter its young wings), there was
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.316#properly speaking only one kind of public and APPROXIMATELY artistical
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.317#discourse--that delivered from the pulpit. The preacher was the only one
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.318#in Germany who knew the weight of a syllable or a word, in what manner a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.319#sentence strikes, springs, rushes, flows, and comes to a close; he alone
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.320#had a conscience in his ears, often enough a bad conscience: for reasons
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.321#are not lacking why proficiency in oratory should be especially seldom
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.322#attained by a German, or almost always too late. The masterpiece of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.323#German prose is therefore with good reason the masterpiece of its
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.324#greatest preacher: the BIBLE has hitherto been the best German

urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.326#"literature"--something which has not grown in Germany, and therefore
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.327#has not taken and does not take root in German hearts, as the Bible has
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.328#done.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.329#248. There are two kinds of geniuses: one which above all engenders and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.330#seeks to engender, and another which willingly lets itself be fructified
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.331#and brings forth. And similarly, among the gifted nations, there are
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.332#those on whom the woman's problem of pregnancy has devolved, and the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.333#secret task of forming, maturing, and perfecting--the Greeks, for
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.334#instance, were a nation of this kind, and so are the French; and others
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.335#which have to fructify and become the cause of new modes of life--like
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.336#the Jews, the Romans, and, in all modesty be it asked: like the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.337#Germans?--nations tortured and enraptured by unknown fevers and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.338#irresistibly forced out of themselves, amorous and longing for
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.339#foreign races (for such as "let themselves be fructified"), and withal
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.340#imperious, like everything conscious of being full of generative force,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.341#and consequently empowered "by the grace of God." These two kinds of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.342#geniuses seek each other like man and woman; but they also misunderstand
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.343#each other--like man and woman.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.344#249. Every nation has its own "Tartuffery," and calls that its
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.345#virtue.--One does not know--cannot know, the best that is in one.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.346#250. What Europe owes to the Jews?--Many things, good and bad, and above
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.347#all one thing of the nature both of the best and the worst: the grand
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.348#style in morality, the fearfulness and majesty of infinite demands, of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.349#infinite significations, the whole Romanticism and sublimity of moral
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.350#questionableness--and consequently just the most attractive, ensnaring,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.351#and exquisite element in those iridescences and allurements to life,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.352#in the aftersheen of which the sky of our European culture, its evening
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.353#sky, now glows--perhaps glows out. For this, we artists among the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.354#spectators and philosophers, are--grateful to the Jews.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.355#251. It must be taken into the bargain, if various clouds and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.356#disturbances--in short, slight attacks of stupidity--pass over the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.357#spirit of a people that suffers and WANTS to suffer from national
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.358#nervous fever and political ambition: for instance, among present-day
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.359#Germans there is alternately the anti-French folly, the anti-Semitic
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.360#folly, the anti-Polish folly, the Christian-romantic folly, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.361#Wagnerian folly, the Teutonic folly, the Prussian folly (just look at
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.362#those poor historians, the Sybels and Treitschkes, and their closely
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.363#bandaged heads), and whatever else these little obscurations of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.364#German spirit and conscience may be called. May it be forgiven me that
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.365#I, too, when on a short daring sojourn on very infected ground, did not
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.366#remain wholly exempt from the disease, but like every one else, began
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.367#to entertain thoughts about matters which did not concern me--the first
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.368#symptom of political infection. About the Jews, for instance, listen
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.369#to the following:--I have never yet met a German who was favourably
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.370#inclined to the Jews; and however decided the repudiation of actual
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.371#anti-Semitism may be on the part of all prudent and political men, this
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.372#prudence and policy is not perhaps directed against the nature of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.373#sentiment itself, but only against its dangerous excess, and especially
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.374#against the distasteful and infamous expression of this excess of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.375#sentiment;--on this point we must not deceive ourselves. That Germany
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.376#has amply SUFFICIENT Jews, that the German stomach, the German blood,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.377#has difficulty (and will long have difficulty) in disposing only of this
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.378#quantity of "Jew"--as the Italian, the Frenchman, and the Englishman
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.379#have done by means of a stronger digestion:--that is the unmistakable
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.380#declaration and language of a general instinct, to which one must listen
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.381#and according to which one must act. "Let no more Jews come in! And shut
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.382#the doors, especially towards the East (also towards Austria)!"--thus
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.383#commands the instinct of a people whose nature is still feeble and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.384#uncertain, so that it could be easily wiped out, easily extinguished, by
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.385#a stronger race. The Jews, however, are beyond all doubt the strongest,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.386#toughest, and purest race at present living in Europe, they know how
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.387#to succeed even under the worst conditions (in fact better than under
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.388#favourable ones), by means of virtues of some sort, which one would like
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.389#nowadays to label as vices--owing above all to a resolute faith which
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.390#does not need to be ashamed before "modern ideas", they alter only,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.391#WHEN they do alter, in the same way that the Russian Empire makes
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.392#its conquest--as an empire that has plenty of time and is not of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.393#yesterday--namely, according to the principle, "as slowly as possible"!
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.394#A thinker who has the future of Europe at heart, will, in all his
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.395#perspectives concerning the future, calculate upon the Jews, as he
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.396#will calculate upon the Russians, as above all the surest and likeliest
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.397#factors in the great play and battle of forces. That which is at present
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.398#called a "nation" in Europe, and is really rather a RES FACTA than NATA
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.399#(indeed, sometimes confusingly similar to a RES FICTA ET PICTA), is in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.400#every case something evolving, young, easily displaced, and not yet
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.401#a race, much less such a race AERE PERENNUS, as the Jews are such
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.402#"nations" should most carefully avoid all hot-headed rivalry and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.403#hostility! It is certain that the Jews, if they desired--or if they
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.404#were driven to it, as the anti-Semites seem to wish--COULD now have the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.405#ascendancy, nay, literally the supremacy, over Europe, that they are NOT
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.406#working and planning for that end is equally certain. Meanwhile, they
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.407#rather wish and desire, even somewhat importunely, to be insorbed and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.408#absorbed by Europe, they long to be finally settled, authorized, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.409#respected somewhere, and wish to put an end to the nomadic life, to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.410#"wandering Jew",--and one should certainly take account of this impulse
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.411#and tendency, and MAKE ADVANCES to it (it possibly betokens a mitigation
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.412#of the Jewish instincts) for which purpose it would perhaps be useful
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.413#and fair to banish the anti-Semitic bawlers out of the country. One
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.414#should make advances with all prudence, and with selection, pretty much
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.415#as the English nobility do It stands to reason that the more powerful
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.416#and strongly marked types of new Germanism could enter into relation
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.417#with the Jews with the least hesitation, for instance, the nobleman
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.418#officer from the Prussian border it would be interesting in many ways
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.419#to see whether the genius for money and patience (and especially some
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.420#intellect and intellectuality--sadly lacking in the place referred to)
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.421#could not in addition be annexed and trained to the hereditary art of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.422#commanding and obeying--for both of which the country in question has
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.423#now a classic reputation But here it is expedient to break off my festal
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.424#discourse and my sprightly Teutonomania for I have already reached my
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.425#SERIOUS TOPIC, the "European problem," as I understand it, the rearing
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.426#of a new ruling caste for Europe.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.427#252. They are not a philosophical race--the English: Bacon represents an
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.428#ATTACK on the philosophical spirit generally, Hobbes, Hume, and Locke,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.429#an abasement, and a depreciation of the idea of a "philosopher" for more
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.430#than a century. It was AGAINST Hume that Kant uprose and raised himself;
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.431#it was Locke of whom Schelling RIGHTLY said, "JE MEPRISE LOCKE"; in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.432#struggle against the English mechanical stultification of the world,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.433#Hegel and Schopenhauer (along with Goethe) were of one accord; the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.434#two hostile brother-geniuses in philosophy, who pushed in different
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.435#directions towards the opposite poles of German thought, and thereby
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.436#wronged each other as only brothers will do.--What is lacking in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.437#England, and has always been lacking, that half-actor and rhetorician
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.438#knew well enough, the absurd muddle-head, Carlyle, who sought to conceal
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.439#under passionate grimaces what he knew about himself: namely, what was
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.440#LACKING in Carlyle--real POWER of intellect, real DEPTH of intellectual
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.441#perception, in short, philosophy. It is characteristic of such an
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.442#unphilosophical race to hold on firmly to Christianity--they NEED its
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.443#discipline for "moralizing" and humanizing. The Englishman, more gloomy,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.444#sensual, headstrong, and brutal than the German--is for that very
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.445#reason, as the baser of the two, also the most pious: he has all the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.446#MORE NEED of Christianity. To finer nostrils, this English Christianity
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.447#itself has still a characteristic English taint of spleen and alcoholic
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.448#excess, for which, owing to good reasons, it is used as an antidote--the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.449#finer poison to neutralize the coarser: a finer form of poisoning is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.450#in fact a step in advance with coarse-mannered people, a step towards
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.451#spiritualization. The English coarseness and rustic demureness is still
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.452#most satisfactorily disguised by Christian pantomime, and by praying
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.453#and psalm-singing (or, more correctly, it is thereby explained and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.454#differently expressed); and for the herd of drunkards and rakes who
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.455#formerly learned moral grunting under the influence of Methodism (and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.456#more recently as the "Salvation Army"), a penitential fit may really be
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.457#the relatively highest manifestation of "humanity" to which they can
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.458#be elevated: so much may reasonably be admitted. That, however, which
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.459#offends even in the humanest Englishman is his lack of music, to speak
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.460#figuratively (and also literally): he has neither rhythm nor dance in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.461#the movements of his soul and body; indeed, not even the desire for
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.462#rhythm and dance, for "music." Listen to him speaking; look at the most
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.463#beautiful Englishwoman WALKING--in no country on earth are there more
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.464#beautiful doves and swans; finally, listen to them singing! But I ask
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.465#too much...
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.466#253. There are truths which are best recognized by mediocre minds,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.467#because they are best adapted for them, there are truths which only
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.468#possess charms and seductive power for mediocre spirits:--one is pushed
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.469#to this probably unpleasant conclusion, now that the influence of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.470#respectable but mediocre Englishmen--I may mention Darwin, John
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.471#Stuart Mill, and Herbert Spencer--begins to gain the ascendancy in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.472#middle-class region of European taste. Indeed, who could doubt that it
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.473#is a useful thing for SUCH minds to have the ascendancy for a time? It
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.474#would be an error to consider the highly developed and independently
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.475#soaring minds as specially qualified for determining and collecting many
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.476#little common facts, and deducing conclusions from them; as exceptions,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.477#they are rather from the first in no very favourable position towards
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.478#those who are "the rules." After all, they have more to do than merely
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.479#to perceive:--in effect, they have to BE something new, they have to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.480#SIGNIFY something new, they have to REPRESENT new values! The gulf
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.481#between knowledge and capacity is perhaps greater, and also more
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.482#mysterious, than one thinks: the capable man in the grand style, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.483#creator, will possibly have to be an ignorant person;--while on the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.484#other hand, for scientific discoveries like those of Darwin, a certain
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.485#narrowness, aridity, and industrious carefulness (in short, something
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.486#English) may not be unfavourable for arriving at them.--Finally, let
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.487#it not be forgotten that the English, with their profound mediocrity,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.488#brought about once before a general depression of European intelligence.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.489#What is called "modern ideas," or "the ideas of the eighteenth century,"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.490#or "French ideas"--that, consequently, against which the GERMAN mind
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.491#rose up with profound disgust--is of English origin, there is no doubt
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.492#about it. The French were only the apes and actors of these ideas, their
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.493#best soldiers, and likewise, alas! their first and profoundest VICTIMS;
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.494#for owing to the diabolical Anglomania of "modern ideas," the AME
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.495#FRANCAIS has in the end become so thin and emaciated, that at present
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.496#one recalls its sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, its profound,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.497#passionate strength, its inventive excellency, almost with disbelief.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.498#One must, however, maintain this verdict of historical justice in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.499#a determined manner, and defend it against present prejudices and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.500#appearances: the European NOBLESSE--of sentiment, taste, and manners,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.501#taking the word in every high sense--is the work and invention of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.502#FRANCE; the European ignobleness, the plebeianism of modern ideas--is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.503#ENGLAND'S work and invention.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.504#254. Even at present France is still the seat of the most intellectual
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.505#and refined culture of Europe, it is still the high school of taste; but
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.506#one must know how to find this "France of taste." He who belongs to it
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.507#keeps himself well concealed:--they may be a small number in whom it
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.508#lives and is embodied, besides perhaps being men who do not stand upon
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.509#the strongest legs, in part fatalists, hypochondriacs, invalids, in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.510#part persons over-indulged, over-refined, such as have the AMBITION to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.511#conceal themselves.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.512#They have all something in common: they keep their ears closed in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.513#presence of the delirious folly and noisy spouting of the democratic
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.514#BOURGEOIS. In fact, a besotted and brutalized France at present sprawls
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.515#in the foreground--it recently celebrated a veritable orgy of bad taste,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.516#and at the same time of self-admiration, at the funeral of Victor Hugo.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.517#There is also something else common to them: a predilection to resist
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.518#intellectual Germanizing--and a still greater inability to do so!
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.519#In this France of intellect, which is also a France of pessimism,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.520#Schopenhauer has perhaps become more at home, and more indigenous than
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.521#he has ever been in Germany; not to speak of Heinrich Heine, who has
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.522#long ago been re-incarnated in the more refined and fastidious lyrists
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.523#of Paris; or of Hegel, who at present, in the form of Taine--the FIRST
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.524#of living historians--exercises an almost tyrannical influence. As
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.525#regards Richard Wagner, however, the more French music learns to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.526#adapt itself to the actual needs of the AME MODERNE, the more will it
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.527#"Wagnerite"; one can safely predict that beforehand,--it is already
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.528#taking place sufficiently! There are, however, three things which the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.529#French can still boast of with pride as their heritage and possession,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.530#and as indelible tokens of their ancient intellectual superiority
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.531#in Europe, in spite of all voluntary or involuntary Germanizing and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.532#vulgarizing of taste. FIRSTLY, the capacity for artistic emotion, for
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.533#devotion to "form," for which the expression, L'ART POUR L'ART, along
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.534#with numerous others, has been invented:--such capacity has not been
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.535#lacking in France for three centuries; and owing to its reverence for

urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.537#music of literature possible, which is sought for in vain elsewhere
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.538#in Europe.--The SECOND thing whereby the French can lay claim to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.539#a superiority over Europe is their ancient, many-sided, MORALISTIC
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.540#culture, owing to which one finds on an average, even in the petty
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.541#ROMANCIERS of the newspapers and chance BOULEVARDIERS DE PARIS, a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.542#psychological sensitiveness and curiosity, of which, for example, one
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.543#has no conception (to say nothing of the thing itself!) in Germany.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.544#The Germans lack a couple of centuries of the moralistic work requisite
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.545#thereto, which, as we have said, France has not grudged: those who call
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.546#the Germans "naive" on that account give them commendation for a defect.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.547#(As the opposite of the German inexperience and innocence IN VOLUPTATE
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.548#PSYCHOLOGICA, which is not too remotely associated with the tediousness
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.549#of German intercourse,--and as the most successful expression of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.550#genuine French curiosity and inventive talent in this domain of delicate
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.551#thrills, Henri Beyle may be noted; that remarkable anticipatory and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.552#forerunning man, who, with a Napoleonic TEMPO, traversed HIS Europe,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.553#in fact, several centuries of the European soul, as a surveyor and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.554#discoverer thereof:--it has required two generations to OVERTAKE him
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.555#one way or other, to divine long afterwards some of the riddles
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.556#that perplexed and enraptured him--this strange Epicurean and man of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.557#interrogation, the last great psychologist of France).--There is yet
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.558#a THIRD claim to superiority: in the French character there is a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.559#successful half-way synthesis of the North and South, which makes them
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.560#comprehend many things, and enjoins upon them other things, which an
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.561#Englishman can never comprehend. Their temperament, turned alternately
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.562#to and from the South, in which from time to time the Provencal and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.563#Ligurian blood froths over, preserves them from the dreadful, northern
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.564#grey-in-grey, from sunless conceptual-spectrism and from poverty of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.565#blood--our GERMAN infirmity of taste, for the excessive prevalence
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.566#of which at the present moment, blood and iron, that is to say "high
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.567#politics," has with great resolution been prescribed (according to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.568#a dangerous healing art, which bids me wait and wait, but not yet
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.569#hope).--There is also still in France a pre-understanding and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.570#ready welcome for those rarer and rarely gratified men, who are too
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.571#comprehensive to find satisfaction in any kind of fatherlandism, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.572#know how to love the South when in the North and the North when in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.573#South--the born Midlanders, the "good Europeans." For them BIZET
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.574#has made music, this latest genius, who has seen a new beauty and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.575#seduction,--who has discovered a piece of the SOUTH IN MUSIC.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.576#255. I hold that many precautions should be taken against German music.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.577#Suppose a person loves the South as I love it--as a great school
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.578#of recovery for the most spiritual and the most sensuous ills, as a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.579#boundless solar profusion and effulgence which o'erspreads a sovereign
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.580#existence believing in itself--well, such a person will learn to be
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.581#somewhat on his guard against German music, because, in injuring his
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.582#taste anew, it will also injure his health anew. Such a Southerner, a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.583#Southerner not by origin but by BELIEF, if he should dream of the future
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.584#of music, must also dream of it being freed from the influence of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.585#North; and must have in his ears the prelude to a deeper, mightier, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.586#perhaps more perverse and mysterious music, a super-German music, which
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.587#does not fade, pale, and die away, as all German music does, at the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.588#sight of the blue, wanton sea and the Mediterranean clearness of sky--a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.589#super-European music, which holds its own even in presence of the brown
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.590#sunsets of the desert, whose soul is akin to the palm-tree, and can be
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.591#at home and can roam with big, beautiful, lonely beasts of prey... I
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.592#could imagine a music of which the rarest charm would be that it knew
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.593#nothing more of good and evil; only that here and there perhaps some
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.594#sailor's home-sickness, some golden shadows and tender weaknesses might
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.595#sweep lightly over it; an art which, from the far distance, would see
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.596#the colours of a sinking and almost incomprehensible MORAL world fleeing
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.597#towards it, and would be hospitable enough and profound enough to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.598#receive such belated fugitives.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.599#256. Owing to the morbid estrangement which the nationality-craze has
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.600#induced and still induces among the nations of Europe, owing also to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.601#short-sighted and hasty-handed politicians, who with the help of this
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.602#craze, are at present in power, and do not suspect to what extent the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.603#disintegrating policy they pursue must necessarily be only an interlude
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.604#policy--owing to all this and much else that is altogether unmentionable
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.605#at present, the most unmistakable signs that EUROPE WISHES TO BE ONE,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.606#are now overlooked, or arbitrarily and falsely misinterpreted. With all
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.607#the more profound and large-minded men of this century, the real general
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.608#tendency of the mysterious labour of their souls was to prepare the way
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.609#for that new SYNTHESIS, and tentatively to anticipate the European of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.610#the future; only in their simulations, or in their weaker moments, in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.611#old age perhaps, did they belong to the "fatherlands"--they only rested
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.612#from themselves when they became "patriots." I think of such men as
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.613#Napoleon, Goethe, Beethoven, Stendhal, Heinrich Heine, Schopenhauer: it
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.614#must not be taken amiss if I also count Richard Wagner among them, about
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.615#whom one must not let oneself be deceived by his own misunderstandings
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.616#(geniuses like him have seldom the right to understand themselves),
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.617#still less, of course, by the unseemly noise with which he is now
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.618#resisted and opposed in France: the fact remains, nevertheless, that
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.619#Richard Wagner and the LATER FRENCH ROMANTICISM of the forties, are
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.620#most closely and intimately related to one another. They are akin,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.621#fundamentally akin, in all the heights and depths of their requirements;
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.622#it is Europe, the ONE Europe, whose soul presses urgently and longingly,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.623#outwards and upwards, in their multifarious and boisterous art--whither?
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.624#into a new light? towards a new sun? But who would attempt to express
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.625#accurately what all these masters of new modes of speech could not
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.626#express distinctly? It is certain that the same storm and stress
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.627#tormented them, that they SOUGHT in the same manner, these last great
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.628#seekers! All of them steeped in literature to their eyes and ears--the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.629#first artists of universal literary culture--for the most part even
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.630#themselves writers, poets, intermediaries and blenders of the arts and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.631#the senses (Wagner, as musician is reckoned among painters, as poet
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.632#among musicians, as artist generally among actors); all of them fanatics
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.633#for EXPRESSION "at any cost"--I specially mention Delacroix, the nearest
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.634#related to Wagner; all of them great discoverers in the realm of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.635#sublime, also of the loathsome and dreadful, still greater discoverers
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.636#in effect, in display, in the art of the show-shop; all of them talented
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.637#far beyond their genius, out and out VIRTUOSI, with mysterious accesses
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.638#to all that seduces, allures, constrains, and upsets; born enemies of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.639#logic and of the straight line, hankering after the strange, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.640#exotic, the monstrous, the crooked, and the self-contradictory; as men,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.641#Tantaluses of the will, plebeian parvenus, who knew themselves to be
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.642#incapable of a noble TEMPO or of a LENTO in life and action--think
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.643#of Balzac, for instance,--unrestrained workers, almost destroying
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.644#themselves by work; antinomians and rebels in manners, ambitious and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.645#insatiable, without equilibrium and enjoyment; all of them finally
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.646#shattering and sinking down at the Christian cross (and with right
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.647#and reason, for who of them would have been sufficiently profound and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.648#sufficiently original for an ANTI-CHRISTIAN philosophy?);--on the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.649#whole, a boldly daring, splendidly overbearing, high-flying, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.650#aloft-up-dragging class of higher men, who had first to teach their
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.651#century--and it is the century of the MASSES--the conception "higher
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.652#man."... Let the German friends of Richard Wagner advise together as to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.653#whether there is anything purely German in the Wagnerian art, or whether
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.654#its distinction does not consist precisely in coming from SUPER-GERMAN
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.655#sources and impulses: in which connection it may not be underrated
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.656#how indispensable Paris was to the development of his type, which the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.657#strength of his instincts made him long to visit at the most
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.658#decisive time--and how the whole style of his proceedings, of his
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.659#self-apostolate, could only perfect itself in sight of the French
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.660#socialistic original. On a more subtle comparison it will perhaps be
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.661#found, to the honour of Richard Wagner's German nature, that he has
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.662#acted in everything with more strength, daring, severity, and elevation
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.663#than a nineteenth-century Frenchman could have done--owing to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.664#circumstance that we Germans are as yet nearer to barbarism than the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.665#French;--perhaps even the most remarkable creation of Richard Wagner is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.666#not only at present, but for ever inaccessible, incomprehensible, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.667#inimitable to the whole latter-day Latin race: the figure of Siegfried,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.668#that VERY FREE man, who is probably far too free, too hard, too
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.669#cheerful, too healthy, too ANTI-CATHOLIC for the taste of old and mellow
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.670#civilized nations. He may even have been a sin against Romanticism, this
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.671#anti-Latin Siegfried: well, Wagner atoned amply for this sin in his old
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.672#sad days, when--anticipating a taste which has meanwhile passed into
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.673#politics--he began, with the religious vehemence peculiar to him, to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.674#preach, at least, THE WAY TO ROME, if not to walk therein.--That
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.675#these last words may not be misunderstood, I will call to my aid a few
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.676#powerful rhymes, which will even betray to less delicate ears what I
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.677#mean--what I mean COUNTER TO the "last Wagner" and his Parsifal music:--
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.678#--Is this our mode?--From German heart came this vexed ululating? From
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.679#German body, this self-lacerating? Is ours this priestly hand-dilation,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.680#This incense-fuming exaltation? Is ours this faltering, falling,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.681#shambling, This quite uncertain ding-dong-dangling? This sly
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.682#nun-ogling, Ave-hour-bell ringing, This wholly false enraptured
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.683#heaven-o'erspringing?--Is this our mode?--Think well!--ye still wait for
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:8.684#admission--For what ye hear is ROME--ROME'S FAITH BY INTUITION!
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.1#CHAPTER IX. WHAT IS NOBLE?
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.2#257. EVERY elevation of the type "man," has hitherto been the work of an
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.3#aristocratic society and so it will always be--a society believing in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.4#a long scale of gradations of rank and differences of worth among human
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.5#beings, and requiring slavery in some form or other. Without the PATHOS
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.6#OF DISTANCE, such as grows out of the incarnated difference of classes,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.7#out of the constant out-looking and down-looking of the ruling caste on
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.8#subordinates and instruments, and out of their equally constant
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.9#practice of obeying and commanding, of keeping down and keeping at a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.10#distance--that other more mysterious pathos could never have arisen, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.11#longing for an ever new widening of distance within the soul itself,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.12#the formation of ever higher, rarer, further, more extended, more
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.13#comprehensive states, in short, just the elevation of the type "man,"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.14#the continued "self-surmounting of man," to use a moral formula in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.15#a supermoral sense. To be sure, one must not resign oneself to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.16#any humanitarian illusions about the history of the origin of an
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.17#aristocratic society (that is to say, of the preliminary condition for
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.18#the elevation of the type "man"): the truth is hard. Let us acknowledge
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.19#unprejudicedly how every higher civilization hitherto has ORIGINATED!
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.20#Men with a still natural nature, barbarians in every terrible sense of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.21#the word, men of prey, still in possession of unbroken strength of will
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.22#and desire for power, threw themselves upon weaker, more moral, more
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.23#peaceful races (perhaps trading or cattle-rearing communities), or upon
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.24#old mellow civilizations in which the final vital force was flickering
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.25#out in brilliant fireworks of wit and depravity. At the commencement,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.26#the noble caste was always the barbarian caste: their superiority did
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.27#not consist first of all in their physical, but in their psychical
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.28#power--they were more COMPLETE men (which at every point also implies
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.29#the same as "more complete beasts").
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.30#258. Corruption--as the indication that anarchy threatens to break out
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.31#among the instincts, and that the foundation of the emotions, called
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.32#"life," is convulsed--is something radically different according to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.33#the organization in which it manifests itself. When, for instance, an
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.34#aristocracy like that of France at the beginning of the Revolution,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.35#flung away its privileges with sublime disgust and sacrificed itself
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.36#to an excess of its moral sentiments, it was corruption:--it was really
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.37#only the closing act of the corruption which had existed for centuries,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.38#by virtue of which that aristocracy had abdicated step by step its
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.39#lordly prerogatives and lowered itself to a FUNCTION of royalty (in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.40#the end even to its decoration and parade-dress). The essential thing,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.41#however, in a good and healthy aristocracy is that it should not regard
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.42#itself as a function either of the kingship or the commonwealth, but
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.43#as the SIGNIFICANCE and highest justification thereof--that it should
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.44#therefore accept with a good conscience the sacrifice of a legion
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.45#of individuals, who, FOR ITS SAKE, must be suppressed and reduced to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.46#imperfect men, to slaves and instruments. Its fundamental belief must
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.47#be precisely that society is NOT allowed to exist for its own sake, but
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.48#only as a foundation and scaffolding, by means of which a select class
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.49#of beings may be able to elevate themselves to their higher duties, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.50#in general to a higher EXISTENCE: like those sun-seeking climbing plants
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.51#in Java--they are called Sipo Matador,--which encircle an oak so
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.52#long and so often with their arms, until at last, high above it, but
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.53#supported by it, they can unfold their tops in the open light, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.54#exhibit their happiness.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.55#259. To refrain mutually from injury, from violence, from exploitation,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.56#and put one's will on a par with that of others: this may result in a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.57#certain rough sense in good conduct among individuals when the necessary
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.58#conditions are given (namely, the actual similarity of the individuals
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.59#in amount of force and degree of worth, and their co-relation within one
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.60#organization). As soon, however, as one wished to take this principle
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.61#more generally, and if possible even as the FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.62#SOCIETY, it would immediately disclose what it really is--namely, a Will
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.63#to the DENIAL of life, a principle of dissolution and decay. Here one
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.64#must think profoundly to the very basis and resist all sentimental
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.65#weakness: life itself is ESSENTIALLY appropriation, injury, conquest
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.66#of the strange and weak, suppression, severity, obtrusion of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.67#peculiar forms, incorporation, and at the least, putting it mildest,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.68#exploitation;--but why should one for ever use precisely these words
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.69#on which for ages a disparaging purpose has been stamped? Even the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.70#organization within which, as was previously supposed, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.71#individuals treat each other as equal--it takes place in every
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.72#healthy aristocracy--must itself, if it be a living and not a dying
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.73#organization, do all that towards other bodies, which the individuals
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.74#within it refrain from doing to each other it will have to be the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.75#incarnated Will to Power, it will endeavour to grow, to gain ground,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.76#attract to itself and acquire ascendancy--not owing to any morality or
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.77#immorality, but because it LIVES, and because life IS precisely Will to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.78#Power. On no point, however, is the ordinary consciousness of Europeans
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.79#more unwilling to be corrected than on this matter, people now rave
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.80#everywhere, even under the guise of science, about coming conditions of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.81#society in which "the exploiting character" is to be absent--that sounds
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.82#to my ears as if they promised to invent a mode of life which should
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.83#refrain from all organic functions. "Exploitation" does not belong to a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.84#depraved, or imperfect and primitive society it belongs to the nature of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.85#the living being as a primary organic function, it is a consequence
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.86#of the intrinsic Will to Power, which is precisely the Will to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.87#Life--Granting that as a theory this is a novelty--as a reality it is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.88#the FUNDAMENTAL FACT of all history let us be so far honest towards
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.89#ourselves!
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.90#260. In a tour through the many finer and coarser moralities which have
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.91#hitherto prevailed or still prevail on the earth, I found certain traits
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.92#recurring regularly together, and connected with one another, until
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.93#finally two primary types revealed themselves to me, and a radical
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.94#distinction was brought to light. There is MASTER-MORALITY and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.95#SLAVE-MORALITY,--I would at once add, however, that in all higher and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.96#mixed civilizations, there are also attempts at the reconciliation of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.97#the two moralities, but one finds still oftener the confusion and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.98#mutual misunderstanding of them, indeed sometimes their close
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.99#juxtaposition--even in the same man, within one soul. The distinctions
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.100#of moral values have either originated in a ruling caste, pleasantly
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.101#conscious of being different from the ruled--or among the ruled class,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.102#the slaves and dependents of all sorts. In the first case, when it is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.103#the rulers who determine the conception "good," it is the exalted, proud
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.104#disposition which is regarded as the distinguishing feature, and that
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.105#which determines the order of rank. The noble type of man separates
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.106#from himself the beings in whom the opposite of this exalted, proud
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.107#disposition displays itself he despises them. Let it at once be noted
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.108#that in this first kind of morality the antithesis "good" and "bad"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.109#means practically the same as "noble" and "despicable",--the antithesis
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.110#"good" and "EVIL" is of a different origin. The cowardly, the timid, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.111#insignificant, and those thinking merely of narrow utility are despised;
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.112#moreover, also, the distrustful, with their constrained glances, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.113#self-abasing, the dog-like kind of men who let themselves be abused,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.114#the mendicant flatterers, and above all the liars:--it is a fundamental
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.115#belief of all aristocrats that the common people are untruthful. "We
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.116#truthful ones"--the nobility in ancient Greece called themselves. It is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.117#obvious that everywhere the designations of moral value were at first
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.118#applied to MEN; and were only derivatively and at a later period applied
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.119#to ACTIONS; it is a gross mistake, therefore, when historians of morals
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.120#start with questions like, "Why have sympathetic actions been praised?"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.121#The noble type of man regards HIMSELF as a determiner of values; he
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.122#does not require to be approved of; he passes the judgment: "What is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.123#injurious to me is injurious in itself;" he knows that it is he himself
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.124#only who confers honour on things; he is a CREATOR OF VALUES. He
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.125#honours whatever he recognizes in himself: such morality equals
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.126#self-glorification. In the foreground there is the feeling of plenitude,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.127#of power, which seeks to overflow, the happiness of high tension, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.128#consciousness of a wealth which would fain give and bestow:--the noble
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.129#man also helps the unfortunate, but not--or scarcely--out of pity, but
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.130#rather from an impulse generated by the super-abundance of power. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.131#noble man honours in himself the powerful one, him also who has power
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.132#over himself, who knows how to speak and how to keep silence, who
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.133#takes pleasure in subjecting himself to severity and hardness, and has
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.134#reverence for all that is severe and hard. "Wotan placed a hard heart in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.135#my breast," says an old Scandinavian Saga: it is thus rightly expressed
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.136#from the soul of a proud Viking. Such a type of man is even proud of not
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.137#being made for sympathy; the hero of the Saga therefore adds warningly:
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.138#"He who has not a hard heart when young, will never have one." The noble
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.139#and brave who think thus are the furthest removed from the morality
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.140#which sees precisely in sympathy, or in acting for the good of others,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.141#or in DESINTERESSEMENT, the characteristic of the moral; faith
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.142#in oneself, pride in oneself, a radical enmity and irony towards
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.143#"selflessness," belong as definitely to noble morality, as do a careless
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.144#scorn and precaution in presence of sympathy and the "warm heart."--It
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.145#is the powerful who KNOW how to honour, it is their art, their domain
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.146#for invention. The profound reverence for age and for tradition--all law
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.147#rests on this double reverence,--the belief and prejudice in favour of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.148#ancestors and unfavourable to newcomers, is typical in the morality of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.149#the powerful; and if, reversely, men of "modern ideas" believe almost
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.150#instinctively in "progress" and the "future," and are more and more
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.151#lacking in respect for old age, the ignoble origin of these "ideas" has
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.152#complacently betrayed itself thereby. A morality of the ruling class,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.153#however, is more especially foreign and irritating to present-day taste
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.154#in the sternness of its principle that one has duties only to one's
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.155#equals; that one may act towards beings of a lower rank, towards all
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.156#that is foreign, just as seems good to one, or "as the heart desires,"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.157#and in any case "beyond good and evil": it is here that sympathy and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.158#similar sentiments can have a place. The ability and obligation to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.159#exercise prolonged gratitude and prolonged revenge--both only within the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.160#circle of equals,--artfulness in retaliation, RAFFINEMENT of the idea
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.161#in friendship, a certain necessity to have enemies (as outlets for the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.162#emotions of envy, quarrelsomeness, arrogance--in fact, in order to be
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.163#a good FRIEND): all these are typical characteristics of the noble
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.164#morality, which, as has been pointed out, is not the morality of "modern
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.165#ideas," and is therefore at present difficult to realize, and also to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.166#unearth and disclose.--It is otherwise with the second type of morality,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.167#SLAVE-MORALITY. Supposing that the abused, the oppressed, the suffering,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.168#the unemancipated, the weary, and those uncertain of themselves should
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.169#moralize, what will be the common element in their moral estimates?
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.170#Probably a pessimistic suspicion with regard to the entire situation of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.171#man will find expression, perhaps a condemnation of man, together with
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.172#his situation. The slave has an unfavourable eye for the virtues of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.173#powerful; he has a skepticism and distrust, a REFINEMENT of distrust of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.174#everything "good" that is there honoured--he would fain persuade himself
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.175#that the very happiness there is not genuine. On the other hand, THOSE
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.176#qualities which serve to alleviate the existence of sufferers are
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.177#brought into prominence and flooded with light; it is here that
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.178#sympathy, the kind, helping hand, the warm heart, patience, diligence,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.179#humility, and friendliness attain to honour; for here these are the most
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.180#useful qualities, and almost the only means of supporting the burden of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.181#existence. Slave-morality is essentially the morality of utility.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.182#Here is the seat of the origin of the famous antithesis "good" and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.183#"evil":--power and dangerousness are assumed to reside in the evil,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.184#a certain dreadfulness, subtlety, and strength, which do not admit of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.185#being despised. According to slave-morality, therefore, the "evil" man
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.186#arouses fear; according to master-morality, it is precisely the "good"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.187#man who arouses fear and seeks to arouse it, while the bad man is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.188#regarded as the despicable being. The contrast attains its maximum when,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.189#in accordance with the logical consequences of slave-morality, a shade
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.190#of depreciation--it may be slight and well-intentioned--at last attaches
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.191#itself to the "good" man of this morality; because, according to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.192#servile mode of thought, the good man must in any case be the SAFE
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.193#man: he is good-natured, easily deceived, perhaps a little stupid, un
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.194#bonhomme. Everywhere that slave-morality gains the ascendancy, language
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.195#shows a tendency to approximate the significations of the words "good"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.196#and "stupid."--A last fundamental difference: the desire for FREEDOM,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.197#the instinct for happiness and the refinements of the feeling of liberty
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.198#belong as necessarily to slave-morals and morality, as artifice and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.199#enthusiasm in reverence and devotion are the regular symptoms of an
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.200#aristocratic mode of thinking and estimating.--Hence we can understand
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.201#without further detail why love AS A PASSION--it is our European
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.202#specialty--must absolutely be of noble origin; as is well known, its
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.203#invention is due to the Provencal poet-cavaliers, those brilliant,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.204#ingenious men of the "gai saber," to whom Europe owes so much, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.205#almost owes itself.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.206#261. Vanity is one of the things which are perhaps most difficult for
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.207#a noble man to understand: he will be tempted to deny it, where another
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.208#kind of man thinks he sees it self-evidently. The problem for him is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.209#to represent to his mind beings who seek to arouse a good opinion of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.210#themselves which they themselves do not possess--and consequently also
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.211#do not "deserve,"--and who yet BELIEVE in this good opinion
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.212#afterwards. This seems to him on the one hand such bad taste and so
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.213#self-disrespectful, and on the other hand so grotesquely unreasonable,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.214#that he would like to consider vanity an exception, and is doubtful
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.215#about it in most cases when it is spoken of. He will say, for
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.216#instance: "I may be mistaken about my value, and on the other hand
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.217#may nevertheless demand that my value should be acknowledged by others
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.218#precisely as I rate it:--that, however, is not vanity (but self-conceit,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.219#or, in most cases, that which is called 'humility,' and also
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.220#'modesty')." Or he will even say: "For many reasons I can delight in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.221#the good opinion of others, perhaps because I love and honour them,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.222#and rejoice in all their joys, perhaps also because their good opinion
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.223#endorses and strengthens my belief in my own good opinion, perhaps
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.224#because the good opinion of others, even in cases where I do not share
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.225#it, is useful to me, or gives promise of usefulness:--all this, however,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.226#is not vanity." The man of noble character must first bring it home
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.227#forcibly to his mind, especially with the aid of history, that, from
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.228#time immemorial, in all social strata in any way dependent, the ordinary
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.229#man WAS only that which he PASSED FOR:--not being at all accustomed to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.230#fix values, he did not assign even to himself any other value than that
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.231#which his master assigned to him (it is the peculiar RIGHT OF MASTERS to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.232#create values). It may be looked upon as the result of an extraordinary
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.233#atavism, that the ordinary man, even at present, is still always WAITING
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.234#for an opinion about himself, and then instinctively submitting himself
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.235#to it; yet by no means only to a "good" opinion, but also to a bad
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.236#and unjust one (think, for instance, of the greater part of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.237#self-appreciations and self-depreciations which believing women learn
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.238#from their confessors, and which in general the believing Christian
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.239#learns from his Church). In fact, conformably to the slow rise of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.240#democratic social order (and its cause, the blending of the blood
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.241#of masters and slaves), the originally noble and rare impulse of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.242#the masters to assign a value to themselves and to "think well" of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.243#themselves, will now be more and more encouraged and extended; but
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.244#it has at all times an older, ampler, and more radically ingrained
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.245#propensity opposed to it--and in the phenomenon of "vanity" this older
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.246#propensity overmasters the younger. The vain person rejoices over EVERY
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.247#good opinion which he hears about himself (quite apart from the point
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.248#of view of its usefulness, and equally regardless of its truth or
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.249#falsehood), just as he suffers from every bad opinion: for he subjects
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.250#himself to both, he feels himself subjected to both, by that oldest
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.251#instinct of subjection which breaks forth in him.--It is "the slave"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.252#in the vain man's blood, the remains of the slave's craftiness--and how
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.253#much of the "slave" is still left in woman, for instance!--which
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.254#seeks to SEDUCE to good opinions of itself; it is the slave, too, who
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.255#immediately afterwards falls prostrate himself before these opinions, as
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.256#though he had not called them forth.--And to repeat it again: vanity is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.257#an atavism.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.258#262. A SPECIES originates, and a type becomes established and strong in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.259#the long struggle with essentially constant UNFAVOURABLE conditions. On
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.260#the other hand, it is known by the experience of breeders that species
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.261#which receive super-abundant nourishment, and in general a surplus of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.262#protection and care, immediately tend in the most marked way to develop
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.263#variations, and are fertile in prodigies and monstrosities (also in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.264#monstrous vices). Now look at an aristocratic commonwealth, say
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.265#an ancient Greek polis, or Venice, as a voluntary or involuntary
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.266#contrivance for the purpose of REARING human beings; there are there men
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.267#beside one another, thrown upon their own resources, who want to make
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.268#their species prevail, chiefly because they MUST prevail, or else
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.269#run the terrible danger of being exterminated. The favour, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.270#super-abundance, the protection are there lacking under which variations
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.271#are fostered; the species needs itself as species, as something which,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.272#precisely by virtue of its hardness, its uniformity, and simplicity of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.273#structure, can in general prevail and make itself permanent in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.274#constant struggle with its neighbours, or with rebellious or
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.275#rebellion-threatening vassals. The most varied experience teaches it

urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.277#it still exists, in spite of all Gods and men, and has hitherto been
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.278#victorious: these qualities it calls virtues, and these virtues alone
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.279#it develops to maturity. It does so with severity, indeed it desires
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.280#severity; every aristocratic morality is intolerant in the education
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.281#of youth, in the control of women, in the marriage customs, in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.282#relations of old and young, in the penal laws (which have an eye only
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.283#for the degenerating): it counts intolerance itself among the virtues,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.284#under the name of "justice." A type with few, but very marked features,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.285#a species of severe, warlike, wisely silent, reserved, and reticent
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.286#men (and as such, with the most delicate sensibility for the charm and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.287#nuances of society) is thus established, unaffected by the vicissitudes
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.288#of generations; the constant struggle with uniform UNFAVOURABLE
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.289#conditions is, as already remarked, the cause of a type becoming
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.290#stable and hard. Finally, however, a happy state of things results, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.291#enormous tension is relaxed; there are perhaps no more enemies among the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.292#neighbouring peoples, and the means of life, even of the enjoyment
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.293#of life, are present in superabundance. With one stroke the bond and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.294#constraint of the old discipline severs: it is no longer regarded as
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.295#necessary, as a condition of existence--if it would continue, it can
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.296#only do so as a form of LUXURY, as an archaizing TASTE. Variations,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.297#whether they be deviations (into the higher, finer, and rarer), or
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.298#deteriorations and monstrosities, appear suddenly on the scene in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.299#greatest exuberance and splendour; the individual dares to be individual
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.300#and detach himself. At this turning-point of history there manifest
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.301#themselves, side by side, and often mixed and entangled together, a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.302#magnificent, manifold, virgin-forest-like up-growth and up-striving, a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.303#kind of TROPICAL TEMPO in the rivalry of growth, and an extraordinary
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.304#decay and self-destruction, owing to the savagely opposing and seemingly
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.305#exploding egoisms, which strive with one another "for sun and light,"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.306#and can no longer assign any limit, restraint, or forbearance for
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.307#themselves by means of the hitherto existing morality. It was this
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.308#morality itself which piled up the strength so enormously, which bent
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.309#the bow in so threatening a manner:--it is now "out of date," it is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.310#getting "out of date." The dangerous and disquieting point has been
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.311#reached when the greater, more manifold, more comprehensive life IS
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.312#LIVED BEYOND the old morality; the "individual" stands out, and is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.313#obliged to have recourse to his own law-giving, his own arts and

urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.315#Nothing but new "Whys," nothing but new "Hows," no common formulas any
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.316#longer, misunderstanding and disregard in league with each other, decay,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.317#deterioration, and the loftiest desires frightfully entangled, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.318#genius of the race overflowing from all the cornucopias of good and bad,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.319#a portentous simultaneousness of Spring and Autumn, full of new charms
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.320#and mysteries peculiar to the fresh, still inexhausted, still unwearied
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.321#corruption. Danger is again present, the mother of morality, great
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.322#danger; this time shifted into the individual, into the neighbour and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.323#friend, into the street, into their own child, into their own heart,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.324#into all the most personal and secret recesses of their desires and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.325#volitions. What will the moral philosophers who appear at this time have
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.326#to preach? They discover, these sharp onlookers and loafers, that the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.327#end is quickly approaching, that everything around them decays and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.328#produces decay, that nothing will endure until the day after tomorrow,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.329#except one species of man, the incurably MEDIOCRE. The mediocre alone
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.330#have a prospect of continuing and propagating themselves--they will
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.331#be the men of the future, the sole survivors; "be like them! become
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.332#mediocre!" is now the only morality which has still a significance,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.333#which still obtains a hearing.--But it is difficult to preach this
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.334#morality of mediocrity! it can never avow what it is and what it
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.335#desires! it has to talk of moderation and dignity and duty and brotherly
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.336#love--it will have difficulty IN CONCEALING ITS IRONY!
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.337#263. There is an INSTINCT FOR RANK, which more than anything else is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.338#already the sign of a HIGH rank; there is a DELIGHT in the NUANCES
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.339#of reverence which leads one to infer noble origin and habits. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.340#refinement, goodness, and loftiness of a soul are put to a perilous test
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.341#when something passes by that is of the highest rank, but is not
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.342#yet protected by the awe of authority from obtrusive touches and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.343#incivilities: something that goes its way like a living touchstone,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.344#undistinguished, undiscovered, and tentative, perhaps voluntarily veiled
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.345#and disguised. He whose task and practice it is to investigate souls,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.346#will avail himself of many varieties of this very art to determine the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.347#ultimate value of a soul, the unalterable, innate order of rank to which
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.348#it belongs: he will test it by its INSTINCT FOR REVERENCE. DIFFERENCE
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.349#ENGENDRE HAINE: the vulgarity of many a nature spurts up suddenly like
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.350#dirty water, when any holy vessel, any jewel from closed shrines, any
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.351#book bearing the marks of great destiny, is brought before it; while
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.352#on the other hand, there is an involuntary silence, a hesitation of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.353#eye, a cessation of all gestures, by which it is indicated that a soul
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.354#FEELS the nearness of what is worthiest of respect. The way in which, on
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.355#the whole, the reverence for the BIBLE has hitherto been maintained
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.356#in Europe, is perhaps the best example of discipline and refinement of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.357#manners which Europe owes to Christianity: books of such profoundness
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.358#and supreme significance require for their protection an external
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.359#tyranny of authority, in order to acquire the PERIOD of thousands of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.360#years which is necessary to exhaust and unriddle them. Much has been
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.361#achieved when the sentiment has been at last instilled into the masses
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.362#(the shallow-pates and the boobies of every kind) that they are not
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.363#allowed to touch everything, that there are holy experiences before
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.364#which they must take off their shoes and keep away the unclean hand--it
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.365#is almost their highest advance towards humanity. On the contrary, in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.366#the so-called cultured classes, the believers in "modern ideas," nothing
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.367#is perhaps so repulsive as their lack of shame, the easy insolence of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.368#eye and hand with which they touch, taste, and finger everything; and it
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.369#is possible that even yet there is more RELATIVE nobility of taste, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.370#more tact for reverence among the people, among the lower classes of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.371#the people, especially among peasants, than among the newspaper-reading
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.372#DEMIMONDE of intellect, the cultured class.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.373#264. It cannot be effaced from a man's soul what his ancestors have
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.374#preferably and most constantly done: whether they were perhaps diligent
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.375#economizers attached to a desk and a cash-box, modest and citizen-like
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.376#in their desires, modest also in their virtues; or whether they were
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.377#accustomed to commanding from morning till night, fond of rude pleasures
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.378#and probably of still ruder duties and responsibilities; or whether,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.379#finally, at one time or another, they have sacrificed old privileges of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.380#birth and possession, in order to live wholly for their faith--for their
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.381#"God,"--as men of an inexorable and sensitive conscience, which blushes
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.382#at every compromise. It is quite impossible for a man NOT to have
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.383#the qualities and predilections of his parents and ancestors in his
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.384#constitution, whatever appearances may suggest to the contrary. This is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.385#the problem of race. Granted that one knows something of the parents,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.386#it is admissible to draw a conclusion about the child: any kind
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.387#of offensive incontinence, any kind of sordid envy, or of clumsy
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.388#self-vaunting--the three things which together have constituted the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.389#genuine plebeian type in all times--such must pass over to the child, as
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.390#surely as bad blood; and with the help of the best education and culture
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.391#one will only succeed in DECEIVING with regard to such heredity.--And
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.392#what else does education and culture try to do nowadays! In our very
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.393#democratic, or rather, very plebeian age, "education" and "culture" MUST
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.394#be essentially the art of deceiving--deceiving with regard to origin,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.395#with regard to the inherited plebeianism in body and soul. An educator
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.396#who nowadays preached truthfulness above everything else, and called out
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.397#constantly to his pupils: "Be true! Be natural! Show yourselves as you
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.398#are!"--even such a virtuous and sincere ass would learn in a short time
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.399#to have recourse to the FURCA of Horace, NATURAM EXPELLERE: with what
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.400#results? "Plebeianism" USQUE RECURRET. [FOOTNOTE: Horace's "Epistles,"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.401#I. x. 24.]
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.402#265. At the risk of displeasing innocent ears, I submit that egoism
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.403#belongs to the essence of a noble soul, I mean the unalterable belief
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.404#that to a being such as "we," other beings must naturally be in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.405#subjection, and have to sacrifice themselves. The noble soul accepts the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.406#fact of his egoism without question, and also without consciousness of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.407#harshness, constraint, or arbitrariness therein, but rather as something
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.408#that may have its basis in the primary law of things:--if he sought a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.409#designation for it he would say: "It is justice itself." He acknowledges
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.410#under certain circumstances, which made him hesitate at first, that
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.411#there are other equally privileged ones; as soon as he has settled this
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.412#question of rank, he moves among those equals and equally privileged
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.413#ones with the same assurance, as regards modesty and delicate respect,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.414#which he enjoys in intercourse with himself--in accordance with an
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.415#innate heavenly mechanism which all the stars understand. It is an
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.416#ADDITIONAL instance of his egoism, this artfulness and self-limitation
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.417#in intercourse with his equals--every star is a similar egoist; he
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.418#honours HIMSELF in them, and in the rights which he concedes to them, he
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.419#has no doubt that the exchange of honours and rights, as the ESSENCE of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.420#all intercourse, belongs also to the natural condition of things. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.421#noble soul gives as he takes, prompted by the passionate and sensitive
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.422#instinct of requital, which is at the root of his nature. The notion of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.423#"favour" has, INTER PARES, neither significance nor good repute; there
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.424#may be a sublime way of letting gifts as it were light upon one from
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.425#above, and of drinking them thirstily like dew-drops; but for those
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.426#arts and displays the noble soul has no aptitude. His egoism hinders him
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.427#here: in general, he looks "aloft" unwillingly--he looks either FORWARD,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.428#horizontally and deliberately, or downwards--HE KNOWS THAT HE IS ON A
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.429#HEIGHT.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.430#266. "One can only truly esteem him who does not LOOK OUT FOR
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.431#himself."--Goethe to Rath Schlosser.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.432#267. The Chinese have a proverb which mothers even teach their children:
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.433#"SIAO-SIN" ("MAKE THY HEART SMALL"). This is the essentially fundamental
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.434#tendency in latter-day civilizations. I have no doubt that an ancient
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.435#Greek, also, would first of all remark the self-dwarfing in us Europeans
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.436#of today--in this respect alone we should immediately be "distasteful"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.437#to him.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.438#268. What, after all, is ignobleness?--Words are vocal symbols for
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.439#ideas; ideas, however, are more or less definite mental symbols
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.440#for frequently returning and concurring sensations, for groups of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.441#sensations. It is not sufficient to use the same words in order to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.442#understand one another: we must also employ the same words for the same
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.443#kind of internal experiences, we must in the end have experiences IN
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.444#COMMON. On this account the people of one nation understand one another
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.445#better than those belonging to different nations, even when they use
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.446#the same language; or rather, when people have lived long together under
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.447#similar conditions (of climate, soil, danger, requirement, toil) there
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.448#ORIGINATES therefrom an entity that "understands itself"--namely, a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.449#nation. In all souls a like number of frequently recurring experiences
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.450#have gained the upper hand over those occurring more rarely: about
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.451#these matters people understand one another rapidly and always more
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.452#rapidly--the history of language is the history of a process of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.453#abbreviation; on the basis of this quick comprehension people always
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.454#unite closer and closer. The greater the danger, the greater is the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.455#need of agreeing quickly and readily about what is necessary; not to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.456#misunderstand one another in danger--that is what cannot at all be
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.457#dispensed with in intercourse. Also in all loves and friendships one has
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.458#the experience that nothing of the kind continues when the discovery
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.459#has been made that in using the same words, one of the two parties has
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.460#feelings, thoughts, intuitions, wishes, or fears different from those of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.461#the other. (The fear of the "eternal misunderstanding": that is the good
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.462#genius which so often keeps persons of different sexes from too
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.463#hasty attachments, to which sense and heart prompt them--and NOT some
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.464#Schopenhauerian "genius of the species"!) Whichever groups of sensations
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.465#within a soul awaken most readily, begin to speak, and give the word of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.466#command--these decide as to the general order of rank of its values, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.467#determine ultimately its list of desirable things. A man's estimates of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.468#value betray something of the STRUCTURE of his soul, and wherein it
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.469#sees its conditions of life, its intrinsic needs. Supposing now that
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.470#necessity has from all time drawn together only such men as could
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.471#express similar requirements and similar experiences by similar symbols,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.472#it results on the whole that the easy COMMUNICABILITY of need,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.473#which implies ultimately the undergoing only of average and COMMON
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.474#experiences, must have been the most potent of all the forces which
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.475#have hitherto operated upon mankind. The more similar, the more ordinary
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.476#people, have always had and are still having the advantage; the more
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.477#select, more refined, more unique, and difficultly comprehensible, are
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.478#liable to stand alone; they succumb to accidents in their isolation, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.479#seldom propagate themselves. One must appeal to immense opposing forces,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.480#in order to thwart this natural, all-too-natural PROGRESSUS IN SIMILE,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.481#the evolution of man to the similar, the ordinary, the average, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.482#gregarious--to the IGNOBLE--!
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.483#269. The more a psychologist--a born, an unavoidable psychologist
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.484#and soul-diviner--turns his attention to the more select cases and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.485#individuals, the greater is his danger of being suffocated by sympathy:
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.486#he NEEDS sternness and cheerfulness more than any other man. For
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.487#the corruption, the ruination of higher men, of the more unusually
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.488#constituted souls, is in fact, the rule: it is dreadful to have such a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.489#rule always before one's eyes. The manifold torment of the psychologist
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.490#who has discovered this ruination, who discovers once, and then
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.491#discovers ALMOST repeatedly throughout all history, this universal
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.492#inner "desperateness" of higher men, this eternal "too late!" in every
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.493#sense--may perhaps one day be the cause of his turning with
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.494#bitterness against his own lot, and of his making an attempt at
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.495#self-destruction--of his "going to ruin" himself. One may perceive
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.496#in almost every psychologist a tell-tale inclination for delightful
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.497#intercourse with commonplace and well-ordered men; the fact is thereby
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.498#disclosed that he always requires healing, that he needs a sort
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.499#of flight and forgetfulness, away from what his insight and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.500#incisiveness--from what his "business"--has laid upon his conscience.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.501#The fear of his memory is peculiar to him. He is easily silenced by the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.502#judgment of others; he hears with unmoved countenance how people honour,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.503#admire, love, and glorify, where he has PERCEIVED--or he even conceals
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.504#his silence by expressly assenting to some plausible opinion. Perhaps
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.505#the paradox of his situation becomes so dreadful that, precisely
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.506#where he has learnt GREAT SYMPATHY, together with great CONTEMPT, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.507#multitude, the educated, and the visionaries, have on their part learnt
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.508#great reverence--reverence for "great men" and marvelous animals, for
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.509#the sake of whom one blesses and honours the fatherland, the earth, the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.510#dignity of mankind, and one's own self, to whom one points the young,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.511#and in view of whom one educates them. And who knows but in all great
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.512#instances hitherto just the same happened: that the multitude worshipped
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.513#a God, and that the "God" was only a poor sacrificial animal! SUCCESS
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.514#has always been the greatest liar--and the "work" itself is a success;
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.515#the great statesman, the conqueror, the discoverer, are disguised in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.516#their creations until they are unrecognizable; the "work" of the artist,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.517#of the philosopher, only invents him who has created it, is REPUTED
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.518#to have created it; the "great men," as they are reverenced, are poor
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.519#little fictions composed afterwards; in the world of historical values
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.520#spurious coinage PREVAILS. Those great poets, for example, such as
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.521#Byron, Musset, Poe, Leopardi, Kleist, Gogol (I do not venture to mention
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.522#much greater names, but I have them in my mind), as they now appear, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.523#were perhaps obliged to be: men of the moment, enthusiastic, sensuous,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.524#and childish, light-minded and impulsive in their trust and distrust;
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.525#with souls in which usually some flaw has to be concealed; often taking
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.526#revenge with their works for an internal defilement, often seeking
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.527#forgetfulness in their soaring from a too true memory, often lost in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.528#the mud and almost in love with it, until they become like the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.529#Will-o'-the-Wisps around the swamps, and PRETEND TO BE stars--the people
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.530#then call them idealists,--often struggling with protracted disgust,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.531#with an ever-reappearing phantom of disbelief, which makes them cold,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.532#and obliges them to languish for GLORIA and devour "faith as it is"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.533#out of the hands of intoxicated adulators:--what a TORMENT these great
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.534#artists are and the so-called higher men in general, to him who has once
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.535#found them out! It is thus conceivable that it is just from woman--who
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.536#is clairvoyant in the world of suffering, and also unfortunately eager
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.537#to help and save to an extent far beyond her powers--that THEY have
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.538#learnt so readily those outbreaks of boundless devoted SYMPATHY, which
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.539#the multitude, above all the reverent multitude, do not understand,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.540#and overwhelm with prying and self-gratifying interpretations. This
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.541#sympathizing invariably deceives itself as to its power; woman would
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.542#like to believe that love can do EVERYTHING--it is the SUPERSTITION
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.543#peculiar to her. Alas, he who knows the heart finds out how poor,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.544#helpless, pretentious, and blundering even the best and deepest love
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.545#is--he finds that it rather DESTROYS than saves!--It is possible that
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.546#under the holy fable and travesty of the life of Jesus there is hidden
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.547#one of the most painful cases of the martyrdom of KNOWLEDGE ABOUT LOVE:
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.548#the martyrdom of the most innocent and most craving heart, that
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.549#never had enough of any human love, that DEMANDED love, that demanded
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.550#inexorably and frantically to be loved and nothing else, with terrible
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.551#outbursts against those who refused him their love; the story of a poor
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.552#soul insatiated and insatiable in love, that had to invent hell to send
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.553#thither those who WOULD NOT love him--and that at last, enlightened
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.554#about human love, had to invent a God who is entire love, entire
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.555#CAPACITY for love--who takes pity on human love, because it is so
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.556#paltry, so ignorant! He who has such sentiments, he who has such
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.557#KNOWLEDGE about love--SEEKS for death!--But why should one deal with
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.558#such painful matters? Provided, of course, that one is not obliged to do
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.559#so.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.560#270. The intellectual haughtiness and loathing of every man who has
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.561#suffered deeply--it almost determines the order of rank HOW deeply men
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.562#can suffer--the chilling certainty, with which he is thoroughly imbued
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.563#and coloured, that by virtue of his suffering he KNOWS MORE than the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.564#shrewdest and wisest can ever know, that he has been familiar with,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.565#and "at home" in, many distant, dreadful worlds of which "YOU know
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.566#nothing"!--this silent intellectual haughtiness of the sufferer, this
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.567#pride of the elect of knowledge, of the "initiated," of the almost
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.568#sacrificed, finds all forms of disguise necessary to protect itself from
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.569#contact with officious and sympathizing hands, and in general from all
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.570#that is not its equal in suffering. Profound suffering makes noble:
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.571#it separates.--One of the most refined forms of disguise is Epicurism,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.572#along with a certain ostentatious boldness of taste, which takes
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.573#suffering lightly, and puts itself on the defensive against all that
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.574#is sorrowful and profound. They are "gay men" who make use of gaiety,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.575#because they are misunderstood on account of it--they WISH to be
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.576#misunderstood. There are "scientific minds" who make use of science,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.577#because it gives a gay appearance, and because scientificness leads to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.578#the conclusion that a person is superficial--they WISH to mislead to a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.579#false conclusion. There are free insolent minds which would fain conceal
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.580#and deny that they are broken, proud, incurable hearts (the cynicism of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.581#Hamlet--the case of Galiani); and occasionally folly itself is the mask
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.582#of an unfortunate OVER-ASSURED knowledge.--From which it follows that it
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.583#is the part of a more refined humanity to have reverence "for the mask,"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.584#and not to make use of psychology and curiosity in the wrong place.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.585#271. That which separates two men most profoundly is a different sense
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.586#and grade of purity. What does it matter about all their honesty and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.587#reciprocal usefulness, what does it matter about all their mutual
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.588#good-will: the fact still remains--they "cannot smell each other!" The
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.589#highest instinct for purity places him who is affected with it in the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.590#most extraordinary and dangerous isolation, as a saint: for it is just
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.591#holiness--the highest spiritualization of the instinct in question. Any
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.592#kind of cognizance of an indescribable excess in the joy of the bath,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.593#any kind of ardour or thirst which perpetually impels the soul out
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.594#of night into the morning, and out of gloom, out of "affliction" into
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.595#clearness, brightness, depth, and refinement:--just as much as such a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.596#tendency DISTINGUISHES--it is a noble tendency--it also SEPARATES.--The
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.597#pity of the saint is pity for the FILTH of the human, all-too-human.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.598#And there are grades and heights where pity itself is regarded by him as
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.599#impurity, as filth.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.600#272. Signs of nobility: never to think of lowering our duties to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.601#rank of duties for everybody; to be unwilling to renounce or to share
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.602#our responsibilities; to count our prerogatives, and the exercise of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.603#them, among our DUTIES.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.604#273. A man who strives after great things, looks upon every one whom
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.605#he encounters on his way either as a means of advance, or a delay and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.606#hindrance--or as a temporary resting-place. His peculiar lofty BOUNTY
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.607#to his fellow-men is only possible when he attains his elevation and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.608#dominates. Impatience, and the consciousness of being always condemned
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.609#to comedy up to that time--for even strife is a comedy, and conceals the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.610#end, as every means does--spoil all intercourse for him; this kind of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.611#man is acquainted with solitude, and what is most poisonous in it.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.612#274. THE PROBLEM OF THOSE WHO WAIT.--Happy chances are necessary, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.613#many incalculable elements, in order that a higher man in whom the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.614#solution of a problem is dormant, may yet take action, or "break forth,"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.615#as one might say--at the right moment. On an average it DOES NOT happen;
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.616#and in all corners of the earth there are waiting ones sitting who
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.617#hardly know to what extent they are waiting, and still less that they
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.618#wait in vain. Occasionally, too, the waking call comes too late--the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.619#chance which gives "permission" to take action--when their best youth,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.620#and strength for action have been used up in sitting still; and how many
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.621#a one, just as he "sprang up," has found with horror that his limbs are
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.622#benumbed and his spirits are now too heavy! "It is too late," he has
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.623#said to himself--and has become self-distrustful and henceforth for ever
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.624#useless.--In the domain of genius, may not the "Raphael without
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.625#hands" (taking the expression in its widest sense) perhaps not be the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.626#exception, but the rule?--Perhaps genius is by no means so rare: but
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.627#rather the five hundred HANDS which it requires in order to tyrannize
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.628#over the [GREEK INSERTED HERE], "the right time"--in order to take
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.629#chance by the forelock!
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.630#275. He who does not WISH to see the height of a man, looks all the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.631#more sharply at what is low in him, and in the foreground--and thereby
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.632#betrays himself.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.633#276. In all kinds of injury and loss the lower and coarser soul is
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.634#better off than the nobler soul: the dangers of the latter must be
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.635#greater, the probability that it will come to grief and perish is in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.636#fact immense, considering the multiplicity of the conditions of its
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.637#existence.--In a lizard a finger grows again which has been lost; not so
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.638#in man.--
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.639#277. It is too bad! Always the old story! When a man has finished
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.640#building his house, he finds that he has learnt unawares something
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.641#which he OUGHT absolutely to have known before he--began to build. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.642#eternal, fatal "Too late!" The melancholia of everything COMPLETED--!
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.643#278.--Wanderer, who art thou? I see thee follow thy path without scorn,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.644#without love, with unfathomable eyes, wet and sad as a plummet which has
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.645#returned to the light insatiated out of every depth--what did it seek
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.646#down there?--with a bosom that never sighs, with lips that conceal their
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.647#loathing, with a hand which only slowly grasps: who art thou? what
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.648#hast thou done? Rest thee here: this place has hospitality for every
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.649#one--refresh thyself! And whoever thou art, what is it that now pleases
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.650#thee? What will serve to refresh thee? Only name it, whatever I have
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.651#I offer thee! "To refresh me? To refresh me? Oh, thou prying one,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.652#what sayest thou! But give me, I pray thee---" What? what? Speak out!
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.653#"Another mask! A second mask!"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.654#279. Men of profound sadness betray themselves when they are happy: they
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.655#have a mode of seizing upon happiness as though they would choke and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.656#strangle it, out of jealousy--ah, they know only too well that it will
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.657#flee from them!
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.658#280. "Bad! Bad! What? Does he not--go back?" Yes! But you misunderstand
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.659#him when you complain about it. He goes back like every one who is about
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.660#to make a great spring.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.661#281.--"Will people believe it of me? But I insist that they believe it
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.662#of me: I have always thought very unsatisfactorily of myself and about
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.663#myself, only in very rare cases, only compulsorily, always without
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.664#delight in 'the subject,' ready to digress from 'myself,' and always
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.665#without faith in the result, owing to an unconquerable distrust of the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.666#POSSIBILITY of self-knowledge, which has led me so far as to feel a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.667#CONTRADICTIO IN ADJECTO even in the idea of 'direct knowledge' which
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.668#theorists allow themselves:--this matter of fact is almost the most
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.669#certain thing I know about myself. There must be a sort of repugnance
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.670#in me to BELIEVE anything definite about myself.--Is there perhaps
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.671#some enigma therein? Probably; but fortunately nothing for my own
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.672#teeth.--Perhaps it betrays the species to which I belong?--but not to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.673#myself, as is sufficiently agreeable to me."
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.674#282.--"But what has happened to you?"--"I do not know," he said,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.675#hesitatingly; "perhaps the Harpies have flown over my table."--It
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.676#sometimes happens nowadays that a gentle, sober, retiring man becomes
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.677#suddenly mad, breaks the plates, upsets the table, shrieks, raves,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.678#and shocks everybody--and finally withdraws, ashamed, and raging at
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.679#himself--whither? for what purpose? To famish apart? To suffocate with
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.680#his memories?--To him who has the desires of a lofty and dainty soul,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.681#and only seldom finds his table laid and his food prepared, the danger
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.682#will always be great--nowadays, however, it is extraordinarily so.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.683#Thrown into the midst of a noisy and plebeian age, with which he does
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.684#not like to eat out of the same dish, he may readily perish of hunger
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.685#and thirst--or, should he nevertheless finally "fall to," of sudden
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.686#nausea.--We have probably all sat at tables to which we did not belong;
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.687#and precisely the most spiritual of us, who are most difficult to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.688#nourish, know the dangerous DYSPEPSIA which originates from a sudden
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.689#insight and disillusionment about our food and our messmates--the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.690#AFTER-DINNER NAUSEA.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.691#283. If one wishes to praise at all, it is a delicate and at the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.692#same time a noble self-control, to praise only where one DOES NOT
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.693#agree--otherwise in fact one would praise oneself, which is contrary
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.694#to good taste:--a self-control, to be sure, which offers excellent
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.695#opportunity and provocation to constant MISUNDERSTANDING. To be able to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.696#allow oneself this veritable luxury of taste and morality, one must
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.697#not live among intellectual imbeciles, but rather among men whose
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.698#misunderstandings and mistakes amuse by their refinement--or one will
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.699#have to pay dearly for it!--"He praises me, THEREFORE he acknowledges me
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.700#to be right"--this asinine method of inference spoils half of the life
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.701#of us recluses, for it brings the asses into our neighbourhood and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.702#friendship.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.703#284. To live in a vast and proud tranquility; always beyond... To have,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.704#or not to have, one's emotions, one's For and Against, according to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.705#choice; to lower oneself to them for hours; to SEAT oneself on them as
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.706#upon horses, and often as upon asses:--for one must know how to make
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.707#use of their stupidity as well as of their fire. To conserve one's
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.708#three hundred foregrounds; also one's black spectacles: for there are
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.709#circumstances when nobody must look into our eyes, still less into our
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.710#"motives." And to choose for company that roguish and cheerful vice,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.711#politeness. And to remain master of one's four virtues, courage,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.712#insight, sympathy, and solitude. For solitude is a virtue with us, as
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.713#a sublime bent and bias to purity, which divines that in the contact of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.714#man and man--"in society"--it must be unavoidably impure. All society
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.715#makes one somehow, somewhere, or sometime--"commonplace."
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.716#285. The greatest events and thoughts--the greatest thoughts, however,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.717#are the greatest events--are longest in being comprehended: the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.718#generations which are contemporary with them do not EXPERIENCE such
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.719#events--they live past them. Something happens there as in the realm of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.720#stars. The light of the furthest stars is longest in reaching man; and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.721#before it has arrived man DENIES--that there are stars there. "How
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.722#many centuries does a mind require to be understood?"--that is also a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.723#standard, one also makes a gradation of rank and an etiquette therewith,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.724#such as is necessary for mind and for star.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.725#286. "Here is the prospect free, the mind exalted." [FOOTNOTE: Goethe's
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.726#"Faust," Part II, Act V. The words of Dr. Marianus.]--But there is a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.727#reverse kind of man, who is also upon a height, and has also a free
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.728#prospect--but looks DOWNWARDS.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.729#287. What is noble? What does the word "noble" still mean for us
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.730#nowadays? How does the noble man betray himself, how is he recognized
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.731#under this heavy overcast sky of the commencing plebeianism, by which
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.732#everything is rendered opaque and leaden?--It is not his actions which
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.733#establish his claim--actions are always ambiguous, always inscrutable;
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.734#neither is it his "works." One finds nowadays among artists and scholars
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.735#plenty of those who betray by their works that a profound longing for
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.736#nobleness impels them; but this very NEED of nobleness is radically
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.737#different from the needs of the noble soul itself, and is in fact the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.738#eloquent and dangerous sign of the lack thereof. It is not the works,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.739#but the BELIEF which is here decisive and determines the order of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.740#rank--to employ once more an old religious formula with a new and deeper
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.741#meaning--it is some fundamental certainty which a noble soul has about
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.742#itself, something which is not to be sought, is not to be found, and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.743#perhaps, also, is not to be lost.--THE NOBLE SOUL HAS REVERENCE FOR
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.744#ITSELF.--
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.745#288. There are men who are unavoidably intellectual, let them turn
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.746#and twist themselves as they will, and hold their hands before their
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.747#treacherous eyes--as though the hand were not a betrayer; it always
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.748#comes out at last that they have something which they hide--namely,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.749#intellect. One of the subtlest means of deceiving, at least as long as
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.750#possible, and of successfully representing oneself to be stupider
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.751#than one really is--which in everyday life is often as desirable as
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.752#an umbrella,--is called ENTHUSIASM, including what belongs to it, for
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.753#instance, virtue. For as Galiani said, who was obliged to know it: VERTU
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.754#EST ENTHOUSIASME.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.755#289. In the writings of a recluse one always hears something of the echo
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.756#of the wilderness, something of the murmuring tones and timid vigilance
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.757#of solitude; in his strongest words, even in his cry itself, there
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.758#sounds a new and more dangerous kind of silence, of concealment. He who
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.759#has sat day and night, from year's end to year's end, alone with his
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.760#soul in familiar discord and discourse, he who has become a cave-bear,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.761#or a treasure-seeker, or a treasure-guardian and dragon in his cave--it
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.762#may be a labyrinth, but can also be a gold-mine--his ideas themselves
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.763#eventually acquire a twilight-colour of their own, and an odour, as much
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.764#of the depth as of the mould, something uncommunicative and repulsive,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.765#which blows chilly upon every passer-by. The recluse does not believe
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.766#that a philosopher--supposing that a philosopher has always in the first
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.767#place been a recluse--ever expressed his actual and ultimate opinions in
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.768#books: are not books written precisely to hide what is in us?--indeed,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.769#he will doubt whether a philosopher CAN have "ultimate and actual"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.770#opinions at all; whether behind every cave in him there is not, and must
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.771#necessarily be, a still deeper cave: an ampler, stranger, richer
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.772#world beyond the surface, an abyss behind every bottom, beneath every
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.773#"foundation." Every philosophy is a foreground philosophy--this is a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.774#recluse's verdict: "There is something arbitrary in the fact that the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.775#PHILOSOPHER came to a stand here, took a retrospect, and looked around;
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.776#that he HERE laid his spade aside and did not dig any deeper--there
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.777#is also something suspicious in it." Every philosophy also CONCEALS a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.778#philosophy; every opinion is also a LURKING-PLACE, every word is also a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.779#MASK.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.780#290. Every deep thinker is more afraid of being understood than of being
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.781#misunderstood. The latter perhaps wounds his vanity; but the former
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.782#wounds his heart, his sympathy, which always says: "Ah, why would you
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.783#also have as hard a time of it as I have?"
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.784#291. Man, a COMPLEX, mendacious, artful, and inscrutable animal, uncanny
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.785#to the other animals by his artifice and sagacity, rather than by his
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.786#strength, has invented the good conscience in order finally to enjoy his
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.787#soul as something SIMPLE; and the whole of morality is a long, audacious
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.788#falsification, by virtue of which generally enjoyment at the sight of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.789#the soul becomes possible. From this point of view there is perhaps much
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.790#more in the conception of "art" than is generally believed.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.791#292. A philosopher: that is a man who constantly experiences, sees,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.792#hears, suspects, hopes, and dreams extraordinary things; who is struck
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.793#by his own thoughts as if they came from the outside, from above and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.794#below, as a species of events and lightning-flashes PECULIAR TO HIM; who
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.795#is perhaps himself a storm pregnant with new lightnings; a portentous
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.796#man, around whom there is always rumbling and mumbling and gaping and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.797#something uncanny going on. A philosopher: alas, a being who often
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.798#runs away from himself, is often afraid of himself--but whose curiosity
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.799#always makes him "come to himself" again.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.800#293. A man who says: "I like that, I take it for my own, and mean to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.801#guard and protect it from every one"; a man who can conduct a case,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.802#carry out a resolution, remain true to an opinion, keep hold of a woman,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.803#punish and overthrow insolence; a man who has his indignation and his
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.804#sword, and to whom the weak, the suffering, the oppressed, and even the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.805#animals willingly submit and naturally belong; in short, a man who is a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.806#MASTER by nature--when such a man has sympathy, well! THAT sympathy has
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.807#value! But of what account is the sympathy of those who suffer! Or of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.808#those even who preach sympathy! There is nowadays, throughout almost the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.809#whole of Europe, a sickly irritability and sensitiveness towards pain,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.810#and also a repulsive irrestrainableness in complaining, an effeminizing,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.811#which, with the aid of religion and philosophical nonsense, seeks
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.812#to deck itself out as something superior--there is a regular cult of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.813#suffering. The UNMANLINESS of that which is called "sympathy" by such
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.814#groups of visionaries, is always, I believe, the first thing that
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.815#strikes the eye.--One must resolutely and radically taboo this latest
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.816#form of bad taste; and finally I wish people to put the good amulet,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.817#"GAI SABER" ("gay science," in ordinary language), on heart and neck, as
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.818#a protection against it.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.819#294. THE OLYMPIAN VICE.--Despite the philosopher who, as a genuine
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.820#Englishman, tried to bring laughter into bad repute in all thinking
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.821#minds--"Laughing is a bad infirmity of human nature, which every
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.822#thinking mind will strive to overcome" (Hobbes),--I would even
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.823#allow myself to rank philosophers according to the quality of their
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.824#laughing--up to those who are capable of GOLDEN laughter. And supposing
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.825#that Gods also philosophize, which I am strongly inclined to believe,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.826#owing to many reasons--I have no doubt that they also know how to laugh
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.827#thereby in an overman-like and new fashion--and at the expense of all
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.828#serious things! Gods are fond of ridicule: it seems that they cannot
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.829#refrain from laughter even in holy matters.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.830#295. The genius of the heart, as that great mysterious one possesses
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.831#it, the tempter-god and born rat-catcher of consciences, whose voice can
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.832#descend into the nether-world of every soul, who neither speaks a word
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.833#nor casts a glance in which there may not be some motive or touch
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.834#of allurement, to whose perfection it pertains that he knows how to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.835#appear,--not as he is, but in a guise which acts as an ADDITIONAL
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.836#constraint on his followers to press ever closer to him, to follow him
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.837#more cordially and thoroughly;--the genius of the heart, which imposes
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.838#silence and attention on everything loud and self-conceited, which
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.839#smoothes rough souls and makes them taste a new longing--to lie placid
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.840#as a mirror, that the deep heavens may be reflected in them;--the genius
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.841#of the heart, which teaches the clumsy and too hasty hand to hesitate,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.842#and to grasp more delicately; which scents the hidden and forgotten
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.843#treasure, the drop of goodness and sweet spirituality under thick dark
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.844#ice, and is a divining-rod for every grain of gold, long buried and
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.845#imprisoned in mud and sand; the genius of the heart, from contact with
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.846#which every one goes away richer; not favoured or surprised, not as
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.847#though gratified and oppressed by the good things of others; but richer
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.848#in himself, newer than before, broken up, blown upon, and sounded by a
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.849#thawing wind; more uncertain, perhaps, more delicate, more fragile, more
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.850#bruised, but full of hopes which as yet lack names, full of a new will
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.851#and current, full of a new ill-will and counter-current... but what am I
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.852#doing, my friends? Of whom am I talking to you? Have I forgotten myself
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.853#so far that I have not even told you his name? Unless it be that you
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.854#have already divined of your own accord who this questionable God
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.855#and spirit is, that wishes to be PRAISED in such a manner? For, as it
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.856#happens to every one who from childhood onward has always been on his
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.857#legs, and in foreign lands, I have also encountered on my path many
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.858#strange and dangerous spirits; above all, however, and again and again,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.859#the one of whom I have just spoken: in fact, no less a personage than
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.860#the God DIONYSUS, the great equivocator and tempter, to whom, as you
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.861#know, I once offered in all secrecy and reverence my first-fruits--the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.862#last, as it seems to me, who has offered a SACRIFICE to him, for I
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.863#have found no one who could understand what I was then doing. In
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.864#the meantime, however, I have learned much, far too much, about the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.865#philosophy of this God, and, as I said, from mouth to mouth--I, the last
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.866#disciple and initiate of the God Dionysus: and perhaps I might at last
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.867#begin to give you, my friends, as far as I am allowed, a little taste of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.868#this philosophy? In a hushed voice, as is but seemly: for it has to do
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.869#with much that is secret, new, strange, wonderful, and uncanny. The
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.870#very fact that Dionysus is a philosopher, and that therefore Gods also
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.871#philosophize, seems to me a novelty which is not unensnaring, and might
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.872#perhaps arouse suspicion precisely among philosophers;--among you, my
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.873#friends, there is less to be said against it, except that it comes too
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.874#late and not at the right time; for, as it has been disclosed to me, you
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.875#are loth nowadays to believe in God and gods. It may happen, too, that
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.876#in the frankness of my story I must go further than is agreeable to the
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.877#strict usages of your ears? Certainly the God in question went further,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.878#very much further, in such dialogues, and was always many paces ahead of
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.879#me... Indeed, if it were allowed, I should have to give him, according
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.880#to human usage, fine ceremonious tides of lustre and merit, I should
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.881#have to extol his courage as investigator and discoverer, his fearless
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.882#honesty, truthfulness, and love of wisdom. But such a God does not know
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.883#what to do with all that respectable trumpery and pomp. "Keep that," he
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.884#would say, "for thyself and those like thee, and whoever else require
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.885#it! I--have no reason to cover my nakedness!" One suspects that this
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.886#kind of divinity and philosopher perhaps lacks shame?--He once said:
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.887#"Under certain circumstances I love mankind"--and referred thereby to
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.888#Ariadne, who was present; "in my opinion man is an agreeable, brave,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.889#inventive animal, that has not his equal upon earth, he makes his way
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.890#even through all labyrinths. I like man, and often think how I can
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.891#still further advance him, and make him stronger, more evil, and more
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.892#profound."--"Stronger, more evil, and more profound?" I asked in horror.
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.893#"Yes," he said again, "stronger, more evil, and more profound; also more
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.894#beautiful"--and thereby the tempter-god smiled with his halcyon smile,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.895#as though he had just paid some charming compliment. One here sees at
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.896#once that it is not only shame that this divinity lacks;--and in general
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.897#there are good grounds for supposing that in some things the Gods could
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.898#all of them come to us men for instruction. We men are--more human.--
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.899#296. Alas! what are you, after all, my written and painted thoughts! Not
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.900#long ago you were so variegated, young and malicious, so full of thorns
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.901#and secret spices, that you made me sneeze and laugh--and now? You

urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.922#                      My summer's park!
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.923#     Uneaseful joy to look, to lurk, to hark--
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.924#     I peer for friends, am ready day and night,--

urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.930#     And thrust themselves yet higher to the blue,

urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.946#                      Yet from Me sprung?
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.947#     A wrestler, by himself too oft self-wrung?
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.948#     Hindering too oft my own self's potency,

urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.953#     Where no man dwells, on lonesome ice-lorn fell,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.954#     And unlearned Man and God and curse and prayer?
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.955#     Became a ghost haunting the glaciers bare?

urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.959#     Go! Yet not in wrath. Ye could ne'er live here.

urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.975#     What linked us once together, one hope's tie--

urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.981#     Oh! Friends no more! They are--what name for those?--
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.982#                           Friends' phantom-flight
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.983#     Knocking at my heart's window-pane at night,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.984#     Gazing on me, that speaks "We were" and goes,--

urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.999#     This song is done,--the sweet sad cry of rue
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.1000#                       Sang out its end;

urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.1008#     The world now laughs, the grisly veil was torn,
urn:cts:fuTexts:douglase.narrative.mcelvern:9.1009#     And Light and Dark were one that wedding-morn.
